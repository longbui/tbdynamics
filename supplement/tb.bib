  abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) is an endemic zoonosis in Morocco caused by Mycobacterium bovis, which infects many domestic animals and is transmitted to humans through consumption of raw milk or from contact with infected animals. The prevalence of BTB in Moroccan cattle is estimated at 18\%, and 33\% at the individual and the herd level respectively, but the human M. bovis burden needs further clarification. The current control strategy based on test and slaughter should be improved through local context adaptation taking into account a suitable compensation in order to reduce BTB prevalence in Morocco and decrease the disease burden in humans and animals. We established a simple compartmental deterministic mathematical model for BTB transmission in cattle and humans to provide a general understanding of BTB, in particular regarding transmission to humans. Differential equations were used to model the different pathways between the compartments for cattle and humans. Scenarios of test and slaughter were simulated to determine the effects of varying the proportion of tested animals (p) on the time to elimination of BTB (individual animal prevalence of less than one in a thousand) in cattle and humans. The time to freedom from disease ranged from 75 years for p = 20\% to 12 years for p = 100\%. For p {$>$} 60\% the time to elimination was less than 20 years. The cumulated cost was largely stable: for p values higher than 40\%, cost ranged from 1.47 to 1.60 billion euros with a time frame of 12 to 32 years to reach freedom from disease. The model simulations also suggest that using a 2mm cut off instead of a 4mm cut off in the Single Intradermal Comparative Cervical Tuberculin skin test (SICCT) would result in cheaper and quicker elimination programs. This analysis informs Moroccan bovine tuberculosis control policy regarding time frame, range of cost and levels of intervention. However, further research is needed to clarify the national human-bovine tuberculosis ratio in Morocco.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2017 Abakar et al.},

  abstract = {Linezolid is widely used for drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) but has a narrow therapeutic index. To inform dose optimization, we aimed to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of linezolid in South African participants with DR-TB and explore the effect of covariates, including HIV coinfection, on drug exposure. Data were obtained from pharmacokinetic substudies in a randomized controlled trial and an observational cohort study, both of which enrolled adults with drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis. Participants underwent intensive and sparse plasma sampling. We analyzed linezolid concentration data using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling and performed simulations to estimate attainment of putative efficacy and toxicity targets. A total of 124 participants provided 444 plasma samples; 116 were on the standard daily dose of 600 mg, while 19 had dose reduction to 300 mg due to adverse events. Sixty-one participants were female, 71 were HIV-positive, and their median weight was 56 kg (interquartile range [IQR], 50 to 63). In the final model, typical values for clearance and central volume were 3.57 liters/h and 40.2 liters, respectively. HIV coinfection had no significant effect on linezolid exposure. Simulations showed that 600-mg dosing achieved the efficacy target (area under the concentration-time curve for the free, unbound fraction of the drug [fAUC0 - 24h=minimal inhibitory concentration =MIC] . 119 at a MIC level of 0.5 mg/liter) with 96\% probability but had 56\% probability of exceeding safety target (trough24h . 2mg=liter. The 300-mg dose did not achieve adequate efficacy exposures. Our model characterized population pharmacokinetics of linezolid in South African patients with DR-TB and supports the 600-mg daily dose with safety monitoring.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2021 American Society for Microbiology.

  abstract = {The control of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle herds in the Republic of Ireland (ROI) is partially hindered by spill-back infection from wild badgers (Meles meles). The aim of this study was to determine the relative effects of interventions (combinations of culling and/or vaccination) on bTB dynamics in an Irish badger population. A spatial agent-based stochastic simulation model was developed to evaluate the effect of various control strategies for bovine tuberculosis in badgers: single control strategies (culling, selective culling, vaccination, and vaccine baits), and combined strategies (Test vaccinate/cull (TVC)), split area approaches using culling and vaccination, or selective culling and vaccination, and mixed scenarios where culling was conducted for five years and followed by vaccination or by a TVC strategy. The effect of each control strategy was evaluated over a 20-year period. Badger control was simulated in 25\%, 50\%, and 75\% area (limited area strategy) or in the entire area (100\%, wide area strategy). For endemic bTB, a culling strategy was successful in eradicating bTB from the population only if applied as an area-wide strategy. However, this was achieved only by risking the extinction of the badger population. Selective culling strategies (selective culling or TVC) mitigated this negative impact on the badger population's viability. Furthermore, both strategies (selective culling and TVC) allowed the badger population to recover gradually, in compensation for the population reduction following the initial use of removal strategies. The model predicted that vaccination can be effective in reducing bTB prevalence in badgers, when used in combination with culling strategies (i.e. TVC or other strategies). If fecundity was reduced below its natural levels (e.g. by using wildlife contraceptives), the effectiveness of vaccination strategies improved. Split-area simulations highlighted that interventions can have indirect effects (e.g. on population size) in non-treatment areas. Our model suggests that mixed control strategies could maintain infection prevalence to a low level for a considerable period even with a growing population. The model supported the hypothesis that culling strategies appeared to be the most effective method for the control of bTB in badgers using parameters, where available, from ROI, either singly or in combination with other strategies. In this model, the success of a vaccination strategy depended partially upon population density and the proportion of the population infected, therefore an initial culling program (to reduce density and/or remove infected badgers) followed by long-term vaccination may be effective in controlling bTB in badgers.

  abstract = {Background: Maximising the efficiency of national tuberculosis programmes is key to improving service coverage, outcomes, and progress towards End TB targets. We aimed to determine the overall efficiency of tuberculosis spending and investigate associated factors in 121 low-income and middle-income countries between 2010 and 2019. Method(s): In this data envelopment and stochastic frontier analysis, we used data from the WHO Global TB report series on tuberculosis spending as the input and treatment coverage as the output to estimate tuberculosis spending efficiency. We investigated associations between 25 independent variables and overall efficiency. Finding(s): We estimated global tuberculosis spending efficiency to be between 73.8\% (95\% CI 71.2-76.3) and 87.7\% (84.9-90.6) in 2019, depending on the analytical method used. This estimate suggests that existing global tuberculosis treatment coverage could be increased by between 12.3\% (95\% CI 9.4-15.1) and 26.2\% (23.7-28.8) for the same amount of spending. Efficiency has improved over the study period, mainly since 2015, but a substantial difference of 70.7-72.1 percentage points between the most and least efficient countries still exists. We found a consistent significant association between efficiency and current health expenditure as a share of gross domestic product, out-of-pocket spending on health, and some Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators such as universal health coverage. Interpretation(s): To improve efficiency, treatment coverage will need to be increased, particularly in the least efficient contexts where this might require additional spending. However, progress towards global End TB targets is slow even in the most efficient countries. Variables associated with TB spending efficiency suggest efficiency is complimented by commitments to improving health-care access that is free at the point of use and wider progress towards the SDGs. These findings support calls for additional investment in tuberculosis care. Funding(s): None.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2022 World Health Organization},

  abstract = {The adoption of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) risk-based trading (RBT) schemes has the potential to reduce the risk of bTB spread. However, any scheme will have cost implications that need to be balanced against its likely success in reducing bTB. This paper describes the first stochastic quantitative model assessing the impact of the implementation of a cattle risk-based trading scheme to inform policy makers and contribute to cost-benefit analyses. A risk assessment for England and Wales was developed to estimate the number of infected cattle traded using historic movement data recorded between July 2010 and June 2011. Three scenarios were implemented: cattle traded with no RBT scheme in place, voluntary provision of the score and a compulsory, statutory scheme applying a bTB risk score to each farm. For each scenario, changes in trade were estimated due to provision of the risk score to potential purchasers. An estimated mean of 3981 bTB infected animals were sold to purchasers with no RBT scheme in place in one year, with 90\% confidence the true value was between 2775 and 5288. This result is dependent on the estimated between herd prevalence used in the risk assessment which is uncertain. With the voluntary provision of the risk score by farmers, on average, 17\% of movements was affected (purchaser did not wish to buy once the risk score was available), with a reduction of 23\% in infected animals being purchased initially. The compulsory provision of the risk score in a statutory scheme resulted in an estimated mean change to 26\% of movements, with a reduction of 37\% in infected animals being purchased initially, increasing to a 53\% reduction in infected movements from higher risk sellers (score 4 and 5). The estimated mean reduction in infected animals being purchased could be improved to 45\% given a 10\% reduction in risky purchase behaviour by farmers which may be achieved through education programmes, or to an estimated mean of 49\% if a rule was implemented preventing farmers from the purchase of animals of higher risk than their own herd. Given voluntary trials currently taking place of a trading scheme, recommendations for future work include the monitoring of initial uptake and changes in the purchase patterns of farmers. Such data could be used to update the risk assessment to reduce uncertainty associated with model estimates. Crown Copyright \textcopyright{} 2015. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis is a contagious disease submitted to regulatory texts, for which collective control measures have been implemented in France since 1955. These measures were effective, as the prevalence of the bovine tuberculosis decreased during years, until France obtained from the European Union the bovine tuberculosis free status in 2001. Since, the reduction of regulatory measures has been the rule in order to reduce surveillance's costs. However, prevalence of bovine tuberculosis is rising again since 2005 in France and is becoming once again an important concern for the sanitary authorities. Therefore, the evaluation of the bovine tuberculosis surveillance system seemed to be relevant, regarding its effectiveness and its costs. Currently, those indicators have never been estimated for this surveillance system in France. The purpose of this study was to elaborate scenario trees that would represent the surveillance protocols of bovine tuberculosis in farms, and to estimate quantitatively the input parameters for stochastic simulations. Scenario tree structures containing all infection and detection category nodes have been built, allowing the creation of a scientific basis for the upcoming studies. In addition, many data were not available concerning factors influencing the detection of the bovine tuberculosis; it was therefore necessary to consult experts on this matter. The experts' answers for each branch of the scenario trees, as well as the input parameters deduced by them, were presented in this article, allowing a first estimation of the influence of field conditions on the characteristics of screening tests in the farm.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2017 L'Association pour l'Etude de l'Epidemiologie des Maladies Animales.

Strain genotyping (IS6110 typing, spoligotyping, 24-loci MIRU-VNTR and SNP typing) was performed and demographic information collected. Among 73 MTBC strains analysed, we identified seven phylogenetic lineages, dominated by Beijing strains (49\%). Beijing strains were further differentiated in two main branches, Beijing-A (n = 8) and -B (n = 28), that show distinct genotyping patterns and are characterized by specific deletion profiles (Beijing A: only RD105, RD207 deleted; Beijing B: RD150 and RD181 additionally deleted). Many Kiribati strains (59\% based on IS6110 typing of all strains) occurred in clusters, suggesting ongoing local transmission. Beijing-B strains and over-crowded living conditions were associated with strain clustering (likely recent transmission), however little evidence of anti-tuberculous drug resistance was observed. We suggest enhanced case finding amongst close contacts and continued supervised treatment of all identified cases using standard first-line drugs to reduce TB burden in Kiribati. Beijing strains can be subdivided in different principle branches that might be associated with differential spreading patterns in the population.},

  abstract = {Background: Monitoring malaria transmission is a critical component of efforts to achieve targets for elimination and eradication. Two commonly monitored metrics of transmission intensity are parasite prevalence (PR) and the entomological inoculation rate (EIR). Comparing the spatial and temporal variations in the PR and EIR of a given geographical region and modelling the relationship between the two metrics may provide a fuller picture of the malaria epidemiology of the region to inform control activities. Method(s): Using geostatistical methods, we compare the spatial and temporal patterns of Plasmodium falciparum EIR and PR using data collected over 38 months in a rural area of Malawi. We then quantify the relationship between EIR and PR by using empirical and mechanistic statistical models. Result(s): Hotspots identified through the EIR and PR partly overlapped during high transmission seasons but not during low transmission seasons. The estimated relationship showed a 1-month delayed effect of EIR on PR such that at lower levels of EIR, increases in EIR are associated with rapid rise in PR, whereas at higher levels of EIR, changes in EIR do not translate into notable changes in PR. Conclusion(s): Our study emphasises the need for integrated malaria control strategies that combine vector and human host managements monitored by both entomological and parasitaemia indices.Copyright Amoah et al.},

  abstract = {Given the panoply of system-level diseases that result from disordered inflammation, such as sepsis, atherosclerosis, cancer, and autoimmune disorders, understanding and characterizing the inflammatory response is a key target of biomedical research. Untangling the complex behavioral configurations associated with a process as ubiquitous as inflammation represents a prototype of the translational dilemma: the ability to translate mechanistic knowledge into effective therapeutics. A critical failure point in the current research environment is a throughput bottleneck at the level of evaluating hypotheses of mechanistic causality; these hypotheses represent the key step toward the application of knowledge for therapy development and design. Addressing the translational dilemma will require utilizing the ever-increasing power of computers and computational modeling to increase the efficiency of the scientific method in the identification and evaluation of hypotheses of mechanistic causality. More specifically, development needs to focus on facilitating the ability of non-computer trained biomedical researchers to utilize and instantiate their knowledge in dynamic computational models. This is termed dynamic knowledge representation. Agent-based modeling is an object-oriented, discrete-event, rule-based simulation method that is well suited for biomedical dynamic knowledge representation. Agent-based modeling has been used in the study of inflammation at multiple scales. The ability of agent-based modeling to encompass multiple scales of biological process as well as spatial considerations, coupled with an intuitive modeling paradigm, suggest that this modeling framework is well suited for addressing the translational dilemma. This review describes agent-based modeling, gives examples of its applications in the study of inflammation, and introduces a proposed general expansion of the use of modeling and simulation to augment the generation and evaluation of knowledge by the biomedical research community at large. \textcopyright{} 2012 Begell House, Inc.},

Such patients are usually screened by symptoms and sputum smear, which have poor sensitivity. Objective(s): To project the clinical and economic outcomes of using Xpert MTB/RIF(Xpert), a rapid TB/rifampicin-resistance diagnostic, to screen individuals initiating ART. Desing: We used a microsimulation model to evaluate the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of alternative TB screening modalities - in all patients or only symptomatic patients - for hypothetical cohorts of individuals initiating ART in South Africa (mean CD4 cell count = 171 cells/mul; TB prevalence 22\%). We simulated no active screening and four diagnostic strategies, smear microscopy (sensitivity 23\%); smear and culture (sensitivity, 100\%); one Xpert sample (sensitivity in smear-negative TB: 43\%); two Xpert samples (sensitivity in smear-negative TB: 62\%). Outcomes included projected life expectancy, lifetime costs (2010 US\$), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Strategies with ICERs less than \$7100 (South African gross domestic product per capita) were considered very cost-effective. Result(s): Compared with no screening, life expectancy in TB-infected patients increased by 1.6 months using smear in symptomatic patients and by 6.6 months with two Xpert samples in all patients. At 22\% TB prevalence, the ICER of smear for all patients was \$2800 per year of life saved (YLS), and of Xpert (two samples) for all patients was \$5100/YLS. Strategies involving one Xpert sample or symptom screening were less efficient. Conclusion(s): Model-based analysis suggests that screening all individuals initiating ART in South Africa with two Xpert samples is very cost-effective. \textcopyright{} 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

  abstract = {Multi-host pathogens are particularly difficult to control, especially when at least one of the hosts acts as a hidden reservoir. Deep sequencing of densely sampled pathogens has the potential to transform this understanding, but requires analytical approaches that jointly consider epidemiological and genetic data to best address this problem. While there has been considerable success in analyses of single species systems, the hidden reservoir problem is relatively under-studied. A well-known exemplar of this problem is bovine Tuberculosis, a disease found in British and Irish cattle caused by Mycobacterium bovis, where the Eurasian badger has long been believed to act as a reservoir but remains of poorly quantified importance except in very specific locations. As a result, the effort that should be directed at controlling disease in badgers is unclear. Here, we analyse densely collected epidemiological and genetic data from a cattle population but do not explicitly consider any data from badgers. We use a simulation modelling approach to show that, in our system, a model that exploits available cattle demographic and herd-to-herd movement data, but only considers the ability of a hidden reservoir to generate pathogen diversity, can be used to choose between different epidemiological scenarios. In our analysis, a model where the reservoir does not generate any diversity but contributes to new infections at a local farm scale are significantly preferred over models which generate diversity and/or spread disease at broader spatial scales. While we cannot directly attribute the role of the reservoir to badgers based on this analysis alone, the result supports the hypothesis that under current cattle control regimes, infected cattle alone cannot sustain M. bovis circulation. Given the observed close phylogenetic relationship for the bacteria taken from cattle and badgers sampled near to each other, the most parsimonious hypothesis is that the reservoir is the infected badger population. More broadly, our approach demonstrates that carefully constructed bespoke models can exploit the combination of genetic and epidemiological data to overcome issues of extreme data bias, and uncover important general characteristics of transmission in multi-host pathogen systems.Copyright: \textcopyright{} 2021 O'Hare et al.

Method(s): A system dynamics simulation model was developed with active engagement of key stakeholders-such as ophthalmologists, senior nurses, healthcare planners and managers, and senior technicians-to verify the model structure and assumptions. The model project the future requirement of ophthalmic nurses, technicians and patient service assistants. Result(s): The number of Singaporeans with eye diseases is projected to more than double by 2040. As a result, the demand for eye care services and eye care workforce is expected to increase significantly under all the plausible scenarios. The increase in eye disease burden is due mainly to population aging-given that the prevalence of eye disease increases with age. Conclusion(s): This research provides a future demand outlook for ophthalmic nurses, technicians and patient service assistants in Singapore and has implications for recruitment and training of ophthalmic nurses and allied health professionals in Singapore.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2019},

  abstract = {Multi drug resistance capacity for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-Mtb) demands the profound need for developing new anti-tuberculosis drugs. The present work is on Mtb-MurC ligase, which is an enzyme involved in biosynthesis of peptidoglycan, a component of Mtb cell wall. In this paper the 3-D structure of Mtb-MurC has been constructed using the templates 1GQQ and 1P31. Structural refinement and energy minimization of the predicted Mtb-MurC ligase model has been carried out by molecular dynamics. The streochemical check failures in the energy minimized model have been evaluated through Procheck, Whatif ProSA, and Verify 3D. Further torsion angles for the side chains of amino acid residues of the developed model were determined using Predictor. Docking analysis of Mtb-MurC model with ligands and natural substrates enabled us to identify specific residues viz. Gly125, Lys126, Arg331, and Arg332, within the Mtb-MurC binding pocket to play an important role in ligand and substrate binding affinity and selectivity. The availability of Mtb-MurC ligase built model, together with insights gained from docking analysis will promote the rational design of potent and selective Mtb-MurC ligase inhibitors as antituberculosis therapeutics. \textcopyright{} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis can exist within a host for lengthy periods, tolerating even antibiotic challenge. This non-heritable, antibiotic tolerant "persister" state, is thought to underlie latent Tuberculosis (TB) infection and a deeper understanding thereof could inform treatment strategies. In addition to experimental studies, mathematical and computational modelling approaches are widely employed to study persistence from both an in vivo and in vitro perspective. However, specialized models (partial differential equations, agent-based, multiscale, etc.) rely on several difficult to determine parameters. In this study, a dynamic mathematical model was developed to predict the response of Mycobacterium smegmatis (a model organism for M. tuberculosis) grown in batch culture and subjected to a range of in vitro environmental stresses. Lag phase dynamics, pH variations and internal nitrogen storage were mechanistically modelled. Experimental results were used to train model parameters using global optimization, with extensive subsequent model validation to ensure extensibility to more complex modelling frameworks. This included an identifiability analysis which indicated that seven of the thirteen model parameters were uniquely identifiable. Non-identifiable parameters were critically evaluated. Model predictions compared to validation data (based on experimental results not used during training) were accurate with less than 16\% maximum absolute percentage error, indicating that the model is accurate even when extrapolating to new experimental conditions. The bulk growth model can be extended to spatially heterogeneous simulations such as an agent-based model to simulate in vitro granuloma models or, eventually, in vivo conditions, where distributed environmental conditions are difficult to measure.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

However, little work has been done to determine the optimal level of investment in contact tracing. In this paper, we present a methodology for evaluating the appropriate level of investment in contact tracing. We develop and apply a simulation model of contact tracing and the spread of an infectious disease among a network of individuals in order to evaluate the cost and effectiveness of different levels of contact tracing. We show that contact tracing is likely to have diminishing returns to scale in investment: incremental investments in contact tracing yield diminishing reductions in disease prevalence. In conjunction with a cost-effectiveness threshold, we then determine the optimal amount that should be invested in contact tracing. We first assume that the only incremental disease control is contact tracing. We then extend the analysis to consider the optimal allocation of a budget between contact tracing and screening for exogenous infection, and between contact tracing and screening for endogenous infection. We discuss how a simulation model of this type, appropriately tailored, could be used as a policy tool for determining the appropriate level of investment in contact tracing for a specific disease in a specific population. We present an example application to contact tracing for chlamydia control. \textcopyright{} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

We apply this theorem to analyze the non-monotonic dynamics of the sigmaB-regulated glyoxylate shunt gene expression in Mycobacterium tuberculosis cells exposed to hypoxia. We first demonstrate that the known network structure is inconsistent with observed dynamics. To resolve this inconsistency we employ the formulated theorem, modeling simulations and optimization along with follow-up dynamic experimental measurements. We show a requirement for post-translational modulation of sigmaB activity in order to reconcile the network dynamics with its topology. The results of this analysis make testable experimental predictions and demonstrate wider applicability of the developed methodology to a wide class of biological systems.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2016 Ascensao et al.},

  abstract = {This study sought to determine the impact of an effective programme of multidrug resistant tuberculosis control (MDRTB) on a population that is witnessing an explosive HIV epidemic among injecting drug users (IDUs), where the prevalence of MDRTB is already high. A transmission model was constructed that represents the dynamics of the drug-susceptible tuberculosis (DSTB), MDRTB and HIV spread among the adult population of Samara Oblast, Russia: from official notifications of tuberculosis and of HIV infection, estimates of MDRTB derived from surveillance studies, population data from official regional statistics, data on transmission probabilities from peer-reviewed publications and informed estimates, and policy-makers' estimates of IDU populations. Two scenarios of programme effectiveness for MDRTB were modelled and run over a period of 10 years to predict cumulative deaths. In a population of 3.3 million with a high prevalence of MDRTB, an emerging epidemic of HIV among IDUs, and a functioning directly observed therapy-short course (DOTS) programme, the model predicts that under low cure rates for MDRTB the expected cumulative deaths from tuberculosis will reach 6303 deaths including 1900 deaths from MDRTB at 10 years. Under high cure rate for MDRTB 4465 deaths will occur including 134 deaths from MDRTB. At 10 years there is little impact on HIV-infected populations from the MDRTB epidemic, but as the HIV epidemic matures the impact becomes substantial. When the model is extended to 20 years cumulative deaths from MDRTB become very high if cure rates for MDRTB are low and cumulative deaths in the HIV-infected population, likewise, are profoundly affected. In the presence of an immature HIV epidemic failure to actively control MDRTB may result in approximately a third more deaths than if effective treatment is given. As the HIV epidemic matures then the impact of MDRTB grows substantially if MDRTB control strategies are ineffective. The epidemiological starting point for these scenarios is present in many regions within the former Soviet Union and this analysis suggests control of MDRTB should be an urgent priority.},

We estimate that the number of HIV-associated-deaths will decline by 30\% with effective harm-reduction programmes but double if these are ineffective. In our model, effective MDRTB and HIV control reduces cumulative tuberculosis deaths by 54\%, cumulative MDRTB deaths 15-fold and cumulative HIV-associated-tuberculosis-deaths 2-fold. Effective MDRTB control, without effective harm-reduction programmes, only reduce tuberculosis deaths by 22\%. However, effective harm-reduction programme with a poor MDRTB control reduce cumulative tuberculosis deaths by 34\%, MDRTB by 14\% and HIV-associated-tuberculosis by 56\%. Even with good control programmes for drug sensitive TB, neglecting harm reduction and MDRTB control will result in 50\% more tuberculosis-related deaths than if both are effectively addressed. Effective harm-reduction programmes reduces cumulative deaths from tuberculosis more substantively than effective MDRTB control. Our finding have important policy implications for communicable disease policies in post-Soviet countries, which need to substantially change if they are to effectively address the emerging HIV and MDRTB epidemics. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We report here atomistic spin simulations of all-optical switching in multilayered structures alternating n monolayers of Tb and m monolayers of Co. By using a two temperature model, we numerically calculate the thermal variation of the magnetization of each sublattice as well as the magnetization dynamics of [[Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text]] multilayers upon incidence of a single laser pulse. In particular, the condition to observe thermally-induced magnetization switching is investigated upon varying systematically both the composition of the sample (n,m) and the laser fluence. The samples with one monolayer of Tb as [[Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text]] and [[Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text]] are showing thermally induced magnetization switching above a fluence threshold. The reversal mechanism is mediated by the residual magnetization of the Tb lattice while the Co is fully demagnetized in agreement with the models developed for ferrimagnetic alloys. The switching is however not fully deterministic but the error rate can be tuned by the damping parameter. Increasing the number of monolayers the switching becomes completely stochastic. The intermixing at the Tb/Co interfaces appears to be a promising way to reduce the stochasticity. These results predict for the first time the possibility of TIMS in [Tb/Co] multilayers and suggest the occurrence of sub-picosecond magnetization reversal using single laser pulses.},

For the purpose of facilitating such works in those countries, a simple epidemiological simulation model was made to calculate annual trends of prevalance and incidence of tuberculosis and infection, tuberculosis mortality and BCG coverage in the population with parameter values averaged in the population, but not specific for age groups or birth year cohorts. Starting with the initial conditions estimated with results of the National Tuberculosis Prevalence Survey, 1953, and the two year Follow up Survey, 1953/1955, 50 year trend was calculated and approximated to the trend observed by the five national surveys made during 1953 1973. It was estimated that the prevalence of bacteriologically confirmable tuberculosis is over 0.1\% during the 5 years from the 1973 survey, the tuberculosis mortality is over 7 per 100,000 and the risk of infection about 0.2\%, unless drastic changes occur in the progress of the National Tuberculosis Programme and the living conditions. Comparing the estimated trend with 'natural course', estimated by the simulation with no tuberculosis programmes, the tuberculosis problem reduction rate by the National Tuberculosis Programme (giving a total of 2397 million treatment years and 52,114 million primary BCG vaccinations during 25 years from 1953) was estimated 46.5\%, 55.6\% and 13.0\% respectively by patient years, tuberculosis deaths and tuberculosis incidence. The number of BCG vaccinations equivalent to one treatment year in the problem reduction was approximately estimated as 352, 457 and 34 respectively by patient years, tuberculosis deaths and tuberculosis incidence for the 25 yr period. Further, the simulation calculation gave a warning information that the prevalence of tuberculosis would go back to its value of 15 years ago in 10 years, should all the tuberculosis programme activities be stopped.

  abstract = {The under-performance of supply chains presents a significant hindrance to disease control in developing countries. Stock-outs of essential medicines lead to treatment interruption which can force changes in patient drug regimens, drive drug resistance and increase mortality. This study is one of few to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of supply chain policies in reducing shortages and costs. This study develops a systems dynamics simulation model of the downstream supply chain for amikacin, a second-line tuberculosis drug using 10years of South African data. We evaluate current supply chain performance in terms of reliability, responsiveness and agility, following the widely-used Supply Chain Operation Reference framework. We simulate 141 scenarios that represent different combinations of supplier characteristics, inventory management strategies and demand forecasting methods to identify the Pareto optimal set of management policies that jointly minimize the number of shortages and total cost. Despite long supplier lead times and unpredictable demand, the amikacin supply chain is 98\% reliable and agile enough to accommodate a 20\% increase in demand without a shortage. However, this is accomplished by overstocking amikacin by 167\%, which incurs high holding costs. The responsiveness of suppliers is low: only 57\% of orders are delivered to the central provincial drug depot within one month. We identify three Pareto optimal safety stock management policies. Short supplier lead time can produce Pareto optimal outcomes even in the absence of other optimal policies. This study produces concrete, actionable guidelines to cost-effectively reduce stock-outs by implementing optimal supply chain policies. Preferentially selecting drug suppliers with short lead times accommodates unexpected changes in demand. Optimal supply chain management should be an essential component of national policy to reduce the mortality rate.Copyright \textcopyright{} The Author 2017.

  abstract = {The EccC enzyme of ESX-1 system contains (i) a membrane bound Rv3870 with single ATPase domain and (ii) a cytoplasmic Rv3871 with two ATPase domains and involved in secretion of ESAT6/CFP10 factor out of the cell. In current study, we have structurally and biochemically characterized the ATPase domain (442-747 residues) of Rv3870 enzyme. The DELTARv3870 eluted as oligomer (\textasciitilde 813 kDa) from Superdex 200 (16/60) column, as identified based on molecular mass standard and dynamics light scattering. The SAXS analysis yielded a tetrameric ring envelope of DELTARv3870, quite consistent to dynamic light scattering data. The DELTARv3870 exhibited ATPase activity having kinetic parameters, Km \textasciitilde{} 100 +/- 40 muM, kcat \textasciitilde{} 1.81 +/- 0.27 min-1 and Vmax \textasciitilde{} 54.41 muM/min/mg. ATPase activity using nine DELTARv3870 mutants showed 70-91\% decrease in catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. DELTARv3870 binds Rv3871 with KD \textasciitilde{} 484.0 +/- 10.3 nM and its catalytic efficiency is enhanced \textasciitilde 6.7-fold in presence of Rv3871. CD data revealed the high TM \textasciitilde{} 82.2 +/- 0.5 degreeC for DELTARv3870 and enhanced in presence of ATP + Mg2+, as observed in dynamics simulation on DELTARv3870 hexameric models. Overall, our structural and biochemical studies on DELTARv3870 have explained the mechanism, which will contribute in development of antivirulence inhibitors against M. tuberculosis.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2021 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The introduction of chronic, infectious diseases by colonizing populations (invasive or reintroduced) is a serious hazard in conservation biology, threatening the original host and other spillover species. Most research on spatial invasion of diseases has pertained to established host populations, either at steady state or fluctuating through time. Within a colonizing population, however, the spread of disease may be influenced by the expansion process of the population itself. Here we explore the simultaneous expansion of a colonizing population and a chronic, nonlethal disease introduced with it, describing basic patterns in homogeneous and structured landscapes and discussing implications for disease management. We describe expected outcomes of such introductions for three qualitatively distinct cases, depending on the relative velocities at which the population and epidemic expand. (1) If transmissibility is low the disease cannot be sustained, although it may first expand its range somewhat around the point of introduction. (2) If transmissibility is moderate but the wavefront velocity for the population, vp, is higher than that for the disease, vd, the disease wave front lags behind that of the population. (3) A highly transmissible disease, with vd {$>$} vp, will invade sufficiently rapidly to track the spread of the host. To test these elementary theoretical predictions, we simulated disease outbreaks in a spatially structured host population occupying a real landscape. We used a spatially explicit, individual-based model of Persian fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica) reintroduced in northern Israel, considering a hypothetical introduction of bovine tuberculosis. Basic patterns of disease expansion in this realistic setting were similar to our conceptual predictions for homogeneous landscapes. Landscape heterogeneity, however, induced the establishment of population activity centers and disease foci within them, leading to jagged wave fronts and causing local variation in the relative velocities at which the population and epidemic expanded. Based on predictions from simple theory and simulations of managed outbreaks, we suggest that the relative velocities at which the population and epidemic expand have important implications for the impact of different management strategies. Recognizing which of our three general cases best describes a particular outbreak will aid in planning an efficient strategy to contain the disease. \textcopyright{} 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

  abstract = {Because of the Australian livestock industries rely overwhelmingly on year-round grazing of pastures, nematode parasites are of major concern. Nematode parasitism is recognized as the cause of the most economically important diseases of sheep, while in cattle, the relative importance of nematode parasitism will probably increase following the eradication of diseases such as brucellosis and tuberculosis. The extraordinarily high prevalence of resistance to benzimidazoles, levamisole and morantel in nematodes parasitising sheep has stimulated the formulation and, to a surprisingly large extent, adoption by farmers of strategic control programmes aimed at preserving the useful life of invermectin. Even so, it is highly likely that we will enter the 21st century with ivermectin resistance. Current research aimed at control in the next century is progressing in three broad directions. First, towards better control using existing anthelmintics through modifications to pharmacokinetics together with integrated management aided by computer simulation models of nematode population biology. Secondly, towards immunological control arising from a better understanding of the ruminant immune response to helminths, particularly in young animals, and finally, a coordinated investigation of genetic resistance, within breeds, of sheep to nematode parasitism. The appearance in the 21st century of novel anthelmintic compounds, most probably as a result of research by the international pharmaceutical industry, may well reduce the sense of urgency driving current Australian research. Nevertheless, success in one or more of these three lines of endeavour will mean a longer and more profitable life for the next generation of anthelmintics marketed in Australia.},

  abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium bovis, presents a major problem to New Zealand agriculture because of the risk that it poses to export-market access. New Zealand research has focused largely on the epidemiology of the disease in wildlife reservoirs, and relatively little is known about the dynamics of the disease in cattle. This study, therefore, investigates bovine tuberculosis (Tb) dynamics within cattle herds, by construction and application of a simple simulation model of disease transmission. The model was designed firstly to estimate rates of disease transmission within herds, and secondly to identify likely consequences of changes in herd Tb-testing policies. Both deterministic and stochastic versions of the model were used to achieve these aims. The model suggests that within-herd Tb transmission does occur and contributes to the reactor rates observed under annual herd testing regimens. The mass-action disease transmission coefficient (proportion of susceptible animals infected per unit time per infectious animal, i.e. not per diseased animal or per reactor), appears to be in the order of 2.7 x 10(-5) per cow per day for a typical herd of around 200 animals, resulting in a contact rate (number of potentially infectious contacts made per infectious cow per day) of about 0.0073. These are average estimates for both beef and dairy herds. Model results suggest that improving the sensitivity of the test used to diagnose bovine Tb would improve control in areas where wildlife reservoirs are absent but have little effect where they are present. Reducing the time between tests of herds on Tb-induced movement control from the current 6 months to 2 or 3 months reduces the average time a herd spends on movement control and hence national Tb prevalence. In the presence of wildlife reservoirs of infection, both the total number of tests and total reactors per unit time increase, but the extent depends on the level of external infection. In all scenarios examined, involving thousands of model runs in total, infection was invariably absent from the modelled herd by the time it was considered clear of Tb based on testing results. This suggests that the caudal fold test is a realistic measure of herd Tb status and that Tb is unlikely to persist in herds under current testing practices in the absence of anergic cattle or an external source of infection. Specificity of the caudal-fold test as used in practice was estimated to be greater than 99\%.},

  abstract = {RESULTS: The forest multi-host model-predicted amplification of TB prevalence due to the presence of pigs. The presence of pigs and/or deer did not jeopardise the success of best practice possum control in eradicating TB from the system, as pigs and deer are effectively end-hosts for TB. Sensitivity analyses indicated these interpretations were robust to uncertainty in model parameter values. The grassland system model predicted that the multi-host species complex could potentially lead to failure of eradication of TB under possum-only control, due to TB persisting in ferret and pig populations in the absence of possum hosts through reciprocal scavenging, resulting in spillback transmission to possums once their populations had started to recover from control., CONCLUSIONS: With respect to management of TB, for modelled forest habitats, 15 years of effective possum control was predicted to eradicate TB from the possum-deer-pig host community, indicating the current focus on possum-only control is appropriate for such areas. For grassland model systems, TB was predicted to persist in the ferret-pig host complex in the absence of possums, potentially jeopardising the effectiveness of possum-only control programmes. However this outcome depended on the occurrence and rate of pigs acquiring TB from ferrets, which is unknown. Thus some estimation of this transmission parameter is required to enable managers to assess if multi-host disease dynamics are important for their TB control programmes., AIM: To explore how the inclusion of multi-host dynamics affects the predicted prevalence of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in possums and other host species following the current best practice for control of TB in large difficult and remote areas, to identify which host species are responsible for changes in predicted prevalence, and whether TB can persist in possum-free host communities., METHODS: Multi-host TB models were constructed, comprising three host species with density-dependent population growth, density-dependent disease transmission and susceptible and infected classes. Models were parameterised for two case studies of current concern in New Zealand, namely chronic TB persistence in a possum-deer-pig complex in extensive forest, and in a possum-pig-ferret complex in unforested semi-arid shrub and grasslands. Persistence of TB in the face of best practice possum control was evaluated from model simulations, and the contribution of different hosts to persistence of TB was assessed by removing each host species in turn from the simulations. A sensitivity test explored how different parameter values affected modelled persistence of TB.},

  abstract = {The use of stochastic models to study the dynamics of infectious diseases is an important tool to understand the epidemiological process. For several directly transmitted diseases, reinfection is a relevant process, which can be expressed by endogenous reactivation of the pathogen or by exogenous reinfection due to direct contact with an infected individual (with smaller reinfection rate sigmabeta than infection rate beta). In this paper, we examine the stochastic susceptible, infected, recovered, infected (SIRI) model simulating the endogenous reactivation by a spontaneous reaction, while exogenous reinfection by a catalytic reaction. Analyzing the mean-field approximations of a site and pairs of sites, and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for the particular case of exogenous reinfection, we obtained continuous phase transitions involving endemic, epidemic, and no transmission phases for the simple approach; the approach of pairs is better to describe the phase transition from endemic phase (susceptible, infected, susceptible (SIS)-like model) to epidemic phase (susceptible, infected, and removed or recovered (SIR)-like model) considering the comparison with MC results; the reinfection increases the peaks of outbreaks until the system reaches endemic phase. For the particular case of endogenous reactivation, the approach of pairs leads to a continuous phase transition from endemic phase (SIS-like model) to no transmission phase. Finally, there is no phase transition when both effects are taken into account. We hope the results of this study can be generalized for the susceptible, exposed, infected, and removed or recovered (SEIR\_\{I\}\^\{E\}) model, for which the state exposed (infected but not infectious), describing more realistically transmitted diseases such as tuberculosis. In future work, we also intend to investigate the effect of network topology on phase transitions when the SIRI model describes both transmitted diseases (sigma{$<$}1) and social contagions (sigma{$>$}1).},

  abstract = {Epidemiological surveillance for many important wildlife diseases relies on samples obtained from hunter-harvested animals. Statistical methods used to calculate sample size requirements assume that the target population is randomly sampled, and therefore the samples are representative of the population. But hunter-harvested samples may not be representative of the population due to disease distribution heterogeneities (e.g. spatial clustering of infected individuals), and harvest-related non-random processes like regulations, hunter selectivity, variable land access, and uneven hunter distribution. Consequently, sample sizes necessary for detection of disease are underestimated and disease detection probabilities are overestimated, resulting in erroneous inferences about disease presence and distribution. We have developed a modeling framework to support the design of efficient disease surveillance programs for wildlife populations. The constituent agent-based models can incorporate real-world heterogeneities associated with disease distribution, harvest, and harvest-based sampling, and can be used to determine population-specific sample sizes necessary for prompt detection of important wildlife diseases like chronic wasting disease and bovine tuberculosis. The modeling framework and its application has been described in detail by Belsare et al. [1]. Here we describe how model scenarios were developed and implemented, and how model outputs were analyzed. The main objectives of this methods paper are to provide users the opportunity to a) assess the reproducibility of the published model results, b) gain an in-depth understanding of model analysis, and c) facilitate adaptation of this modeling framework to other regions and other wildlife disease systems. * The two agent-based models, MOOvPOP and MOOvPOPsurveillance, incorporate real-world heterogeneities underpinned by host characteristics, disease spread dynamics, and sampling biases in hunter-harvested deer. * The modeling framework facilitates iterative analysis of locally relevant disease surveillance scenarios, thereby facilitating sample size calculations for prompt and reliable detection of important wildlife diseases. * Insights gained from modeling studies can be used to inform the design of effective wildlife disease surveillance strategies.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020},

  abstract = {Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a major health problem, leading to a significant disability and patient suffering. Although chronic activation of the immune system is a hallmark of the disease, its pathogenesis is poorly understood, while current treatments only ameliorate the disease and may produce severe side effects. Method(s): Here, we applied a network-based modeling approach based on phosphoproteomic data to uncover the differential activation in signaling wiring between healthy donors, untreated patients, and those under different treatments. Based in the patient-specific networks, we aimed to create a new approach to identify drug combinations that revert signaling to a healthy-like state. We performed ex vivo multiplexed phosphoproteomic assays upon perturbations with multiple drugs and ligands in primary immune cells from 169 subjects (MS patients, n=129 and matched healthy controls, n=40). Patients were either untreated or treated with fingolimod, natalizumab, interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate, or the experimental therapy epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). We generated for each donor a dynamic logic model by fitting a bespoke literature-derived network of MS-related pathways to the perturbation data. Last, we developed an approach based on network topology to identify deregulated interactions whose activity could be reverted to a "healthy-like" status by combination therapy. The experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS was used to validate the prediction of combination therapies. Result(s): Analysis of the models uncovered features of healthy-, disease-, and drug-specific signaling networks. We predicted several combinations with approved MS drugs that could revert signaling to a healthy-like state. Specifically, TGF-beta activated kinase 1 (TAK1) kinase, involved in Transforming growth factor beta-1 proprotein (TGF-beta), Toll-like receptor, B cell receptor, and response to inflammation pathways, was found to be highly deregulated and co-druggable with all MS drugs studied. One of these predicted combinations, fingolimod with a TAK1 inhibitor, was validated in an animal model of MS. Conclusion(s): Our approach based on donor-specific signaling networks enables prediction of targets for combination therapy for MS and other complex diseases.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2021, The Author(s).},

Crystal structures of DprE1 so far reported display significant disordered regions and no structural information is known for DprE2. We used homology modeling, protein threading, molecular docking and dynamics studies to investigate the structural and dynamic features of Mtb DprE1 and DprE2 and DprE1-DprE2 complex. A three-dimensional model for DprE2 was generated using the threading approach coupled with ab initio modeling. A 50 ns simulation of DprE1 and DprE2 revealed the overall stability of the structures. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated the convergence of sampling in both DprE1 and DprE2. In DprE1, residues in the 269-330 area showed considerable fluctuation in agreement with the regions of disorder observed in the reported crystal structures. In DprE2, large fluctuations were detected in residues 95-113, 146-157, and 197-226. The study combined docking and MD simulation studies to map and characterize the key residues involved in DprE1-DprE2 interaction. A 60 ns MD simulation for DprE1-DprE2 complex was also performed. Analysis of data revealed that the docked complex is stabilized by H-bonding, hydrophobic and ionic interactions. The key residues of DprE1 involved in DprE1-DprE2 interactions belong to the disordered region. We also examined the docked complex of DprE1-BTZ043 to investigate the binding pocket of DprE1 and its interactions with the inhibitor BTZ043. In summary, we hypothesize that DprE1-DprE2 interaction is crucial for the synthesis of DPA and DprE1-DprE2 complex may be a new therapeutic target amenable to pharmacological validation. The findings have important implications in tuberculosis (TB) drug discovery and will facilitate drug development efforts against TB.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2015 Bhutani et al.},

  abstract = {Where wildlife disease requires management, culling is frequently considered but not always effective. In the British Isles, control of cattle tuberculosis (TB) is hindered by infection in wild badger (Meles meles) populations. Large-scale badger culling can reduce the incidence of confirmed cattle TB, but these benefits are undermined by culling-induced changes in badger behavior (termed perturbation), which can increase transmission among badgers and from badgers to cattle. Test-vaccinate/remove (TVR) is a novel approach that entails testing individual badgers for infection, vaccinating test-negative animals, and killing test-positive animals. Imperfect capture success, diagnostic sensitivity, and vaccine effectiveness mean that TVR would be expected to leave some infected and some susceptible badgers in the population. Existing simulation models predict that TVR could reduce cattle TB if such smallscale culling causes no perturbation, but could increase cattle TB if considerable perturbation occurs. Using data from a long-term study, we show that past small-scale culling was significantly associated with four metrics of perturbation in badgers: expanded ranging, more frequent immigration, lower genetic relatedness, and elevated prevalence of Mycobacterium bovis, the causative agent of TB. Though we could not reject the hypothesis that culling up to three badgers per social group might avoid perturbation, we also could not reject the hypothesis that killing a single badger prompted detectable perturbation. When considered alongside existing model predictions, our findings suggest that implementation of TVR, scheduled for 2014, risks exacerbating the TB problem rather than controlling it. Ongoing illegal badger culling is likewise expected to increase cattle TB risks.},

  abstract = {Mammography screening is an accepted procedure for early detection of breast tumors among asymptomatic women. Since this procedure involves the use of X rays, it is itself potentially carcinogenic. Although there is general consensus about the benefit of screening for older women, screening practices differ between countries. In this paper radiation risks for these different practices are estimated using a new approach. We model breast cancer induction by ionizing radiation in a cohort of patients exposed to frequent X-ray examinations. The biologically based, mechanistic model provides a better foundation for the extrapolation of risks to different mammography screening practices than empirical models do. The model predicts that the excess relative risk (ERR) doubles when screening starts at age 40 instead of 50 and that a continuation of screening at ages 75 and higher carries little extra risk. The number of induced fatal breast cancers is estimated to be considerably lower than derived from epidemiological studies and from internationally accepted radiation protection risks. The present findings, if used in a risk-benefit analysis for mammography screening, would be more favorable to screening than estimates currently recommended for radiation protection. This has implications for the screening ages that are currently being reconsidered in several countries. \textcopyright{} 2010 by Radiation Research Society.},

  abstract = {Background: Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a zoonotic disease of cattle caused by Mycobacterium bovis, widespread in England and Wales. It has high incidence towards the South West of England and Wales, with much lower incidence to the East and North. A stochastic simulation model was developed to simulate M. bovis transmission among cattle, transfer by cattle movements and transmission from environmental reservoirs (often wildlife and especially badgers). It distinguishes five surveillance streams, including herd tests, pre-movement testing and slaughter surveillance. The model thereby simulates interventions in bTB surveillance and control, and generates outputs directly comparable to detailed disease records. An anonymized version of the executable model with its input data has been released. The model was fitted to cattle bTB records for 2008-2010 in a cross-sectional comparison, and its projection was compared with records from 2010 to 2016 for validation. Result(s): The fitted model explained over 99\% of the variation among numbers of breakdowns in four defined regions and surveillance streams in 2010. It classified 7800 (95\% confidence interval c. 5500 - 14,000) holdings within high incidence regions as exposed to infectious environmental reservoirs, out of over 31,000 cattle holdings identified as potentially exposed to such sources. The model was consistent with previous estimates of low M. bovis transmission rate among cattle, but cattle to cattle transmission was clearly required to generate the number of cattle cases observed. When projected to 2016, the model as fitted to 2010 continued to match the distribution of bTB among counties, although it was notable that the actual distribution of bTB in 2010 was itself a close match for its distribution in 2016. Conclusion(s): The close model fit demonstrated that cattle movements could generate breakdowns as observed in low incidence regions, if persistent environmental reservoirs such as wildlife maintained infection levels in the high incidence regions. The model suggests that environmental reservoirs may be a challenge for control, because, although many holdings are exposed to infection from wildlife or the environment, they are a minority of holdings. Large impacts on disease in wildlife will be required to avoid each individual transmission event to cattle.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2018 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {For infections that are typically asymptomatic, targeted surveillance systems (whereby individuals at increased risk are tested more frequently) will detect infections earlier on average than systems with random testing or in systems where all individuals are tested at the same intervals. However, estimating temporal trends in infection risk using data from such targeted surveillance systems can be challenging. This is similarly a problem for targeted surveillance to detect faults of individual industrial components. The incidence of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in British cattle has been generally increasing in the last thirty years. Cattle herds are routinely tested for evidence of exposure to the aetiological bacteria Mycobacterium bovis, in a targeted surveillance programme in which the testing interval is determined by past local TB incidence and local veterinary discretion. The UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) report the monthly percentage of tests on officially TB-free (OTF) herds resulting in a confirmed positive test for M. bovis (i.e. the percentage of tested herds with OTF status withdrawn), which contains substantial fluctuations (three years apart) within the increasing trend. As the number of herds tested changes over time, this cyclic trend is difficult to interpret. Here we evaluate an alternative to the Defra method in which we distribute each incident event across the period at risk to infer the underlying trends in infection incidence using a stochastic model of cattle herd incidence and testing frequencies fitted to data on the monthly number of herds tested and number of these with OTF status withdrawn in 2003-2010. We show that for an increasing underlying incidence trend, the current Defra approach can produce artefactual fluctuations whereas the alternative method described provides more accurate descriptions of the underlying risks over time. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death in South Africa. The burden of disease varies by age, with peaks in TB notification rates in the HIV-negative population at ages 0-5, 20-24, and 45-49 years. There is little variation between age groups in the rates in the HIV-positive population. The drivers of this age pattern remain unknown. Method(s): We developed an age-structured simulation model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) transmission in Cape Town, South Africa. We considered five states of TB progression: susceptible, infected (latent TB), active TB, treated TB, and treatment default. Latently infected individuals could be re-infected; a previous Mtb infection slowed progression to active disease. We further considered three states of HIV progression: HIV negative, HIV positive, on antiretroviral therapy. To parameterize the model, we analysed treatment outcomes from the Cape Town electronic TB register, social mixing patterns from a Cape Town community and used literature estimates for other parameters. To investigate the main drivers behind the age patterns, we conducted sensitivity analyses on all parameters related to the age structure. Result(s): The model replicated the age patterns in HIV-negative TB notification rates of Cape Town in 2009. Simulated TB notification rate in HIV-negative patients was 1000/100,000 person-years (pyrs) in children aged {$<$}5 years and decreased to 51/100,000 in children 5-15 years. The peak in early adulthood occurred at 25-29 years (463/100,000 pyrs). After a subsequent decline, simulated TB notification rates gradually increased from the age of 30 years. Sensitivity analyses showed that the dip after the early adult peak was due to the protective effect of latent TB and that retreatment TB was mainly responsible for the rise in TB notification rates from the age of 30 years. Conclusion(s): The protective effect of a first latent infection on subsequent infections and the faster progression in previously treated patients are the key determinants of the age-structure of TB notification rates in Cape Town.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2015 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Background: Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell neoplasm with an estimated incidence of 32,000patients per year in the United States. Novel agents and advances in precision medicine for selecting drugs tailoredto an individual have increased the likelihood of remission and prolonged survival. To maximize efficacy of theidentified drug combinations, dosing strategy should also be tailored to an individual, and dynamically dosed as theindividual evolves during treatment. Current dosing strategies are unable to personalize and optimize dosing in acombinatory treatment due to a virtually infinite parameter space as well as stochastic biological behavior. As aresult, dose adjustments are instead dictated by treatment tolerability, while the efficacy outcomes remain sub-optimal. In this pilot clinical trial we aim to test if the gap in the dosing strategy for combinatory treatment for MM canbe addressed with CURATE.AI -clinically validated deterministic AI-derived platform that generates anindividualized profile based only on that individual's data, and recommends the next dose towards optimized efficacywithin the pre-identified tolerability range. CURATE.AI has already been used to prospectively modulate dosingstrategies for indications ranging from oncology (solid tumor) to infectious diseases (HIV/TB) and immunosuppression (liver transplant) . Method(s): In this pilot study, CURATE.AI will be used to provide doserecommendations for bortezomib and cyclophosphamide, or bortezomib and thalidomide in the presence of dexamethasone at a fixed dose (VCD, or VTD combinations). The tested hypothesis is: CURATE.AI-driven dosingwill result in noninferior efficacy with less toxicity and fewer adverse events. The prospective clinical trial design is arandomized, multiphase (Phase 2/Phase 3), parallel two-arm, single-blinded, N-of-1, exploratory pilot trial with 1:1allocation, noninferiority, listed under Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03759093 . The recruitment is expected tocommence in the first quarter of 2020 at National University Hospital in Singapore. Twenty participants fulfillinginclusion criteria (males and females over 21 years [Singapore's legal age for adult consent] with newly diagnosedand evaluable MM, ECOG 0-2, and meeting toxicity criteria with in 21 days from the start of the treatment) will berandomly allocated (1:1) into the control or the experimental arm. The subjects will be blinded to the arm allocation.Subjects in the control arm will receive dosing of VCD or VTD according to standard of care -physician following theSingapore Myeloma Study Group Consensus Guidelines. Subjects in the experimental arm will receive fixeddexamethasone dose as in standard of care, while bortezomib and cyclophosphamide (for VCD treatment) orbortezomib and thalidomide (for VTD treatment) doses will be dynamically modulated with CURATE.AI for eachsubject independently (series of N-of-1) based on that subject's longitudinally collected efficacy output measures.The primary outcome measure is the response rate at the end of cycle 4. The results of this pilot study willadditionally inform the logistical and practical suitability of N-of-1 randomized trial designs for testing personalizationand dynamic dose modulation for oncology.},

  abstract = {Leprosy or Hansen's disease is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. The annual number of new leprosy cases registered worldwide has remained stable over the past years at over 200,000. Early case finding and multidrug therapy have not been able interrupt transmission completely. Elimination requires innovation in control and sustained commitment. Mathematical models can be used to predict the course of leprosy incidence and the effect of intervention strategies. Two compartmental models and one individual-based model have been described in the literature. Both compartmental models investigate the course of leprosy in populations and the long-term impact of control strategies. The individual-based model focusses on transmission within households and the impact of case finding among contacts of new leprosy patients. Major improvement of these models should result from a better understanding of individual differences in exposure to infection and developing leprosy after exposure. Most relevant are contact heterogeneity, heterogeneity in susceptibility and spatial heterogeneity. Furthermore, the existing models have only been applied to a limited number of countries. Parameterization of the models for other areas, in particular those with high incidence, is essential to support current initiatives for the global elimination of leprosy. Many challenges remain in understanding and dealing with leprosy. The support of mathematical models for understanding leprosy epidemiology and supporting policy decision making remains vital.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Priority setting for infectious disease control is increasingly concerned with physical input constraints and other real-world restrictions on implementation and on the decision process. These health system constraints determine the 'feasibility' of interventions and hence impact. However, considering them within mathematical models places additional demands on model structure and relies on data availability. This review aims to provide an overview of published methods for considering constraints in mathematical models of infectious disease. We systematically searched the literature to identify studies employing dynamic transmission models to assess interventions in any infectious disease and geographical area that included non-financial constraints to implementation. Information was extracted on the types of constraints considered and how these were identified and characterised, as well as on the model structures and techniques for incorporating the constraints. A total of 36 studies were retained for analysis. While most dynamic transmission models identified were deterministic compartmental models, stochastic models and agent-based simulations were also successfully used for assessing the effects of non-financial constraints on priority setting. Studies aimed to assess reductions in intervention coverage (and programme costs) as a result of constraints preventing successful roll-out and scale-up, and/or to calculate costs and resources needed to relax these constraints and achieve desired coverage levels. We identified three approaches for incorporating constraints within the analyses: (i) estimation within the disease transmission model; (ii) linking disease transmission and health system models; (iii) optimising under constraints (other than the budget). The review highlighted the viability of expanding model-based priority setting to consider health system constraints. We show strengths and limitations in current approaches to identify and quantify locally-relevant constraints, ranging from simple assumptions to structured elicitation and operational models. Overall, there is a clear need for transparency in the way feasibility is defined as a decision criteria for its systematic operationalisation within models.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2021 The Authors},

  abstract = {To predict the potential severity of outbreaks of infectious diseases such as SARS, HIV, TB and smallpox, a summary parameter, the basic reproduction number R0, is generally calculated from a population-level model. R0 specifies the average number of secondary infections caused by one infected individual during his/her entire infectious period at the start of an outbreak. R0 is used to assess the severity of the outbreak, as well as the strength of the medical and/or behavioral interventions necessary for control. Conventionally, it is assumed that if R0{$>$}1 the outbreak generates an epidemic, and if R0{$<$}1 the outbreak becomes extinct. Here, we use computational and analytical methods to calculate the average number of secondary infections and to show that it does not necessarily represent an epidemic threshold parameter (as it has been generally assumed). Previously we have constructed a new type of individual-level model (ILM) and linked it with a population-level model. Our ILM generates the same temporal incidence and prevalence patterns as the population-level model; we use our ILM to directly calculate the average number of secondary infections (i.e., R0). Surprisingly, we find that this value of R0 calculated from the ILM is very different from the epidemic threshold calculated from the population-level model. This occurs because many different individual-level processes can generate the same incidence and prevalence patterns. We show that obtaining R0 from empirical contact tracing data collected by epidemiologists and using this R0 as a threshold parameter for a population-level model could produce extremely misleading estimates of the infectiousness of the pathogen, the severity of an outbreak, and the strength of the medical and/or behavioral interventions necessary for control. \textcopyright{} 2007 Breban et al.},

Results A 10\% increase in access to treatment among homeless persons with active TB produced larger declines in predicted TB cases and deaths after 10 years (cases and deaths among chronically homeless persons decreased 12.5\% and 19.8\% and among transiently homeless persons dropped 35.9\% and 32.4\%, respectively) than improvements in the effectiveness of treatment programs (cases and deaths among chronically homeless persons declined 7.2\% and 3.1\% and among transiently homeless persons dropped 10.9\% and 4.1\%, respectively). A 10\% increase in access to treatment among homeless persons with latent TB infection led to a 6.7\% decline in TB among chronically homeless persons and a 5.7\% decline among transiently homeless persons, while a 10\% improvement in effectiveness of treatment for latent TB infection was associated with declines of 3.0\% and 3.3\%, respectively.

  abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most complex, persistent and controversial problems facing the British cattle industry, costing the country an estimated 100 million per year. The low sensitivity of the standard diagnostic test leads to considerable ambiguity in determining the main transmission routes of infection, which exacerbates the continuing scientific debate. In turn this uncertainty fuels the fierce public and political disputes on the necessity of controlling badgers to limit the spread of infection. Here we present a dynamic stochastic spatial model for bovine TB in Great Britain that combines within-farm and between-farm transmission. At the farm scale the model incorporates stochastic transmission of infection, maintenance of infection in the environment and a testing protocol that mimics historical government policy. Between-farm transmission has a short-range environmental component and is explicitly driven by movements of individual cattle between farms, as recorded in the Cattle Tracing System. The resultant model replicates the observed annual increase of infection over time as well as the spread of infection into new areas. Given that our model is mechanistic, it can ascribe transmission pathways to each new case; the majority of newly detected cases involve several transmission routes with moving infected cattle, reinfection from an environmental reservoir and poor sensitivity of the diagnostic test all having substantive roles. This underpins our findings on the implications of control measures. Very few of the control options tested have the potential to reverse the observed annual increase, with only intensive strategies such as whole-herd culling or additional national testing proving highly effective, whereas controls focused on a single transmission route are unlikely to be highly effective. \textcopyright{} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {In New Zealand, managing the threat of bovine tuberculosis (TB) to livestock includes population reduction of potentially infectious wildlife, primarily the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). Population control is often targeted on forested buffer zones adjacent to farmland, in order to limit movements of possums across the buffer and reduce the risk of disease transmission to livestock. To assess the effectiveness of buffers in protecting livestock we analysed GPS telemetry data from possums located in untreated forest adjacent to buffers, and used these data to characterise patterns of movement that could lead to possums reaching farmland during the season when most dispersal occurs. Analyses of movement data showed that the direction of dispersal by sub-adult and adult possums and the extent of long exploratory movements were not biased toward forest buffers, even though these provided vacant habitat as suitable for possums as untreated forest. Instead, dispersal and exploratory movements were uncommon even for sub-adult possums and such events typically lasted {$<$}10 days. Dispersing possums settled predominantly in river valleys. A simulation model was developed for the 3-6-month dispersal season; it demonstrated a probability of {$<$}0.001 that an infected possum, originating from a low-density population with low disease prevalence in untreated forest, would move across 3 km of recently controlled forest buffer to reach farmland. Our results indicate short-term reduction in the risk of TB transmission from possums to livestock in New Zealand by the use of depopulated buffer zones, while acknowledging that the threat of disease spread from untreated forest is likely to increase over time as possum population density and, potentially, TB prevalence among those possums, increase in the buffer zone.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2015 Byrom et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.},

Objective(s): This study aims to estimate the incremental effectiveness of DLM versus BDQ in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Method(s): We developed a Markov model based on a cohort with MDR-TB, which consisted of success, failure, loss to follow-up, and death. The cohort simulation was conducted assuming each patient was 36 years old and, lived until age 82, and that the cycle length was 1 year. Patients with an inadequate response to DLM, the background regimen, or BDQ for 2 years were transitioned through the next treatment sequence. We evaluated the incremental effectiveness of the drugs using the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) resulting from this Markov model over a lifetime. Result(s): The incremental effectiveness of DLM (13.96 QALYs) was greater by 2.44 QALYs per patient than the background regimen (11.52 QALY), while the incremental effectiveness of BDQ (10.40 QALY) was higher by 1.14 QALY per patient than the background regimen (9.26 QALY). Consequently, the incremental effectiveness of DLM was relatively more positive by 1.30 QALY than those of BDQ per patient over a lifetime. Limitation(s): This study is a simulation study. Therefore, the treatment sequence for patients may be different in the real world. Conclusion(s): Our lifetime simulated data found that DLM was relatively more favorable than BDQ. A Markov model can be considered an alternative approach when there is an absence of head-to-head clinical data.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

  abstract = {Background: The majority of tuberculosis in migrants to Canada occurs due to reactivation of latent TB infection. Risk of tuberculosis in those with latent tuberculosis infection can be significantly reduced with treatment. Presently, only 2.4\% of new migrants are flagged for post-landing surveillance, which may include latent tuberculosis infection screening; no other migrants receive routine latent tuberculosis infection screening. To aid in reducing the tuberculosis burden in new migrants to Canada, we determined the cost-effectiveness of using different latent tuberculosis infection interventions in migrants under post-arrival surveillance and in all new migrants. Method(s): A discrete event simulation model was developed that focused on a Canadian permanent resident cohort after arrival in Canada, utilizing a ten-year time horizon, healthcare system perspective, and 1.5\% discount rate. Latent tuberculosis infection interventions were evaluated in the population under surveillance (N = 6100) and the total cohort (N = 260,600). In all evaluations, six different screening and treatment combinations were compared to the base case of tuberculin skin test screening followed by isoniazid treatment only in the population under surveillance. Quality adjusted life years, incident tuberculosis cases, and costs were recorded for each intervention and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated in relation to the base case. Result(s): In the population under surveillance (N = 6100), using an interferon-gamma release assay followed by rifampin was dominant compared to the base case, preventing 4.90 cases of tuberculosis, a 4.9\% reduction, adding 4.0 quality adjusted life years, and saving \$353,013 over the ensuing ten-years. Latent tuberculosis infection screening in the total population (N = 260,600) was not cost-effective when compared to the base case, however could potentially prevent 21.8\% of incident tuberculosis cases. Conclusion(s): Screening new migrants under surveillance with an interferon-gamma release assay and treating with rifampin is cost saving, but will not significantly impact TB incidence. Universal latent tuberculosis infection screening and treatment is cost-prohibitive. Research into using risk factors to target screening post-landing may provide alternate solutions.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2017 Campbell et al.

  abstract = {Background. The post-arrival tuberculosis (TB) surveillance system in Canada is inefficient. Ideally, it identifies new permanent residents at increased risk of post-arrival TB. However, the current system has low coverage, poor post-arrival compliance, and low rates of active TB diagnosis in the immediate post-arrival period. The focus is not on latent TB infection (LTBI) diagnosis and/or treatment. The objective of this study was to simulate the effect of improving the current two-year post-immigration surveillance system on TB incidence. Methods. The 2014 Canadian permanent resident cohort was used as the reference population for this evaluation. A discrete event simulation model was developed in Simio, simulating pre-entry surveillance flagging, post-immigration follow-up, LTBI diagnosis and treatment, and incident TB over a two-year time horizon. Post-immigration TB incidence data from Ontario and California were used to populate the model. The model was validated against two-year TB incidence in Ontario. Increased LTBI treatment uptake and surveillance compliance and their impact on two-year TB incidence were modeled. Results. The current surveillance system flags 2.4\% of new permanent residents for surveillance, with 59.8\% complying post-arrival, and 15-68\% completing LTBI treatment. TB incidence in the first two years under the current system was predicted to be 27.3 per 100,000 person years (PY). Removing the surveillance program entirely would result in 27.7 cases per 100,000 PY, corresponding to only a 1.5\% increase. A perfect program with full surveillance compliance and LTBI treatment completion would result in 26.2 cases per 100,000 PY, corresponding to a 4.4\% decrease. Conclusion. The current post-landing surveillance program does little to prevent active TB diagnoses in Canada. Canada could consider shifting to pre-immigration LTBI screening and treatment, reconsider criteria for surveillance to target LTBI post-landing, or help support TB control efforts in high TB incidence countries.},

  abstract = {Rationale \& Objective: In countries with a low tuberculosis (TB) incidence, TB disproportionately affects populations born abroad. TB persists in these populations through reactivation of latent TB infection (LTBI) acquired before immigration. Those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for reactivation and may benefit from LTBI screening and treatment. Study Design: Health administrative data from British Columbia, Canada, were used to inform a cost-effectiveness analysis evaluating LTBI screening in those diagnosed with stage 4 or 5 CKD not requiring dialysis (late-stage CKD) and those who began dialysis therapy. Setting \& Population: Permanent residents establishing residency in British Columbia, Canada, between 1985 and 2012 who had late-stage CKD diagnosed or began dialysis therapy. Intervention(s): Screening with the tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) compared to no LTBI screening at the time of late-stage CKD diagnosis and time of dialysis therapy initiation. Treatment for those who tested positive was isoniazid for 9 months. Outcome(s): Costs (2016 Can \$), TB cases, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for QALYs gained was calculated. Model, Perspective, \& Timeframe: Discrete event simulation model using a health care system perspective, 1.5\% discount rate, and 5-year time horizon. Result(s): Screening with IGRA was superior to the tuberculin skin test in all situations. Screening with IGRA was less expensive and resulted in better outcomes compared to no screening in those initiating dialysis therapy from countries with an elevated TB incidence. In individuals with late-stage CKD, screening with IGRA was only cost-effective in those 60 years or older (cost per QALY gained, {$<\$$}48,000) from countries with an elevated TB incidence. Limitation(s): This study has limitations in generalizability to different epidemiologic settings and in modeling complicated clinical decisions. Conclusion(s): LTBI screening should be considered in non-Canadian-born residents initiating dialysis therapy and those with late stage CKD who are older.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2018 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.},

  abstract = {Even today two bacterial lung infections, namely pneumonia and tuberculosis, are among the 10 most frequent causes of death worldwide. These infections still lack effective treatments in many developing countries and in immunocompromised populations like infants, elderly people and transplanted patients. The interaction between bacteria and the host is a complex system of interlinked intercellular and the intracellular processes, enriched in regulatory structures like positive and negative feedback loops. Severe pathological condition can emerge when the immune system of the host fails to neutralize the infection. This failure can result in systemic spreading of pathogens or overwhelming immune response followed by a systemic inflammatory response. Mathematical modeling is a promising tool to dissect the complexity underlying pathogenesis of bacterial lung infection at the molecular, cellular and tissue levels, and also at the interfaces among levels. In this article, we introduce mathematical and computational modeling frameworks that can be used for investigating molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying bacterial lung infection. Then, we compile and discuss published results on the modeling of regulatory pathways and cell populations relevant for lung infection and inflammation. Finally, we discuss how to make use of this multiplicity of modeling approaches to open new avenues in the search of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying bacterial infection in the lung.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2017 Cantone, Santos, Wentker, Lai and Vera.

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious public health issue in developing countries. Early prediction of TB epidemic is very important for its control and intervention. We aimed to develop an appropriate model for predicting TB epidemics and analyze its seasonality in China. Data of monthly TB incidence cases from January 2005 to December 2011 were obtained from the Ministry of Health, China. A seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model and a hybrid model which combined the SARIMA model and a generalized regression neural network model were used to fit the data from 2005 to 2010. Simulation performance parameters of mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used to compare the goodness-of-fit between these two models. Data from 2011 TB incidence data was used to validate the chosen model. Although both two models could reasonably forecast the incidence of TB, the hybrid model demonstrated better goodness-of-fit than the SARIMA model. For the hybrid model, the MSE, MAE and MAPE were 38969150, 3406.593 and 0.030, respectively. For the SARIMA model, the corresponding figures were 161835310, 8781.971 and 0.076, respectively. The seasonal trend of TB incidence is predicted to have lower monthly incidence in January and February and higher incidence from March to June.

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of disease spread is key to developing effective interventions to control or prevent an epidemic. The structure of the network of contacts over which the disease spreads has been shown to have a strong influence on the outcome of the epidemic, but an open question remains as to whether it is possible to estimate contact network features from data collected in an epidemic. The approach taken in this paper is to examine the distributions of epidemic outcomes arising from epidemics on networks with particular structural features to assess whether that structure could be measured from epidemic data, and what other constraints might be needed to make the problem identifiable. To this end, we vary the network size, mean degree, and transmissibility of the pathogen, as well as the network feature of interest: clustering, degree assortativity or attribute-based preferential mixing. We record several standard measures of the size and spread of the epidemic, as well as measures that describe the shape of the transmission tree in order to ascertain whether there are detectable signals in the final data from the outbreak. The results suggest that there is potential to estimate contact network features from transmission trees or pure epidemic data, particularly for diseases with high transmissibility or for which the relevant contact network is of low mean degree.

  abstract = {Background: Infectious diseases have historically had a large impact on morbidity and mortality, which probably led predictions about the evolution of epidemics have been made for centuries. The objective is to identify the most-frequently used mathematical models and the diseases to which they are applied. Method(s): Publications indexed in Medline between 1 January 2000 and 31 August 2009 were reviewed: each abstract was read and articles that did not comply with the objectives of the study were discarded. The type of infectious disease, the mathematical model applied, the statistical technique used, the model of transmission and the country of the first author were collected. Result(s): Of 617 possible articles, 162 were finally selected. The evolution of articles by years shows a rising trend since 2005. The most-common disease types were unespecified infectious diseases, HIV-AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Among mathematical models there was a predominance of stochastic models. The most-common country of the first author included the European countries, especially UK and USA. The most-widely used model of transmission was the SIR model (21 cases/45l). Of the 58 articles which identified a statistical technique, 12 (20.7\%) used generalized linear models and 11 (19.0\%) used Markov models. Conclusion(s): There is growing interest in the modelling of communicable diseases and substantial innovations may be expected in forthcoming years, above all if their use is extended and applied to "forgotten" communicable diseases or other health problems.},

  abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the causative agent for tuberculosis, the most extended infectious disease around the world. When Mtb enters inside the pulmonary alveolus it is rapidly phagocytosed by the alveolar macrophage. Although this controls the majority of inhaled microorganisms, in this case, Mtb survives inside the macrophage and multiplies. A posterior chemokine and cytokine cascade generated by the irruption of monocytes, neutrophils and posteriorly, by T-cells, does not necessarily stop the growth of the granuloma. Interestingly, the encapsulation process built by fibroblasts is able to surround the lesion and stop its growing. The success of this last process determines if the host enters in an asymptomatic latent state or continues into a life-threatening and infective active tuberculosis disease (TB). Understanding such dichotomic process is challenging, and computational modeling can bring new ideas. Thus, we have modeled the different stages of the infection, first in a single alveolus (a sac with a radius of 0.15 millimeters) and, second, inside a secondary lobule (a compartment of the lungs of around 3 cm3). We have employed stochastic reaction-diffusion equations to model the interactions among the cells and the diffusive transport to neighboring alveolus. The whole set of equations have successfully described the encapsulation process and determine that the size of the lesions depends on its position on the secondary lobule. We conclude that size and shape of the secondary lobule are the relevant variables to control the lesions, and, therefore, to avoid the evolution towards TB development. As lesions appear near to interlobular connective tissue they are easily controlled and their growth is drastically stopped, in this sense secondary lobules with a more flattened shape could control better the lesion.Copyright: \textcopyright{} 2020 Catala et al.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gold mines represent a potential hotspot for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) transmission and may be exacerbating the tuberculosis (TB) epidemic in South Africa. However, the presence of multiple factors complicates estimation of the mining contribution to the TB burden in South Africa. METHODS: We developed two models of TB in South Africa, a static risk model and an individual-based model that accounts for longer-term trends. Both models account for four populations - mine workers, peri-mining residents, labor-sending residents, and other residents of South Africa - including the size and prevalence of latent TB infection, active TB, and HIV of each population and mixing between populations. We calibrated to mine- and country-level data and used the static model to estimate force of infection (FOI) and new infections attributable to local residents in each community compared to other residents. Using the individual-based model, we simulated a counterfactual scenario to estimate the fraction of overall TB incidence in South Africa attributable to recent transmission in mines. RESULTS: We estimated that the majority of FOI in each community is attributable to local residents: 93.9\% (95\% confidence interval 92.4-95.1\%), 91.5\% (91.4-91.5\%), and 94.7\% (94.7-94.7\%) in gold mining, peri-mining, and labor-sending communities, respectively. Assuming a higher rate of Mtb transmission in mines, 4.1\% (2.6-5.8\%), 5.0\% (4.5-5.5\%), and 9.0\% (8.8-9.1\%) of new infections in South Africa are attributable to gold mine workers, peri-mining residents, and labor-sending residents, respectively. Therefore, mine workers with TB disease, who constitute \textasciitilde\,2.5\% of the prevalent TB cases in South Africa, contribute 1.62 (1.04-2.30) times as many new infections as TB cases in South Africa on average. By modeling TB on a longer time scale, we estimate 63.0\% (58.5-67.7\%) of incident TB disease in gold mining communities to be attributable to recent transmission, of which 92.5\% (92.1-92.9\%) is attributable to local transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Gold mine workers are estimated to contribute a disproportionately large number of Mtb infections in South Africa on a per-capita basis. However, mine workers contribute only a small fraction of overall Mtb infections in South Africa. Our results suggest that curtailing transmission in mines may have limited impact at the country level, despite potentially significant impact at the mining level.},

Therefore, mine workers with TB disease, who constitute \textasciitilde{} 2.5\% of the prevalent TB cases in South Africa, contribute 1.62 (1.04-2.30) times as many new infections as TB cases in South Africa on average. By modeling TB on a longer time scale, we estimate 63.0\% (58.5-67.7\%) of incident TB disease in gold mining communities to be attributable to recent transmission, of which 92.5\% (92.1-92.9\%) is attributable to local transmission. Conclusion(s): Gold mine workers are estimated to contribute a disproportionately large number of Mtb infections in South Africa on a per-capita basis. However, mine workers contribute only a small fraction of overall Mtb infections in South Africa. Our results suggest that curtailing transmission in mines may have limited impact at the country level, despite potentially significant impact at the mining level.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2018 The Author(s).}

Method(s): We conducted a systematic review following the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology group statement. English language articles providing odds ratio data regarding tuberculosis risk among ABO groups were eligible. Least-squares approach random-model network and random-model pairwise meta-analyses were conducted. The protocol-specified primary outcome was tuberculosis risk among ABO groups in the form of odds ratios calculated via a network meta-analysis. Result(s): We identified 28 studies with 30 populations comprising 15,664 patients with tuberculosis and 254,610 controls. Subjects with AB blood type had a higher risk of becoming infected with tuberculosis than those with blood type O (odds ratio (OR) = 1.26, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.14-1.38), A (OR = 1.25, 95\% CI: 1.14-1.38), and B (OR = 1.22, 95\% CI: 1.11-1.34). Pairwise comparison revealed that AB blood type was a risk factor for tuberculosis with OR = 1.23 (95\% CI: 1.02-1.48) compared to other blood types. Region-based subgroup analyses suggested that the AB blood group was a substantial risk in Africa (OR = 1.78, 95\% CI: 1.39-2.28) and India (OR = 1.48, 95\% CI: 1.14-1.92). Conclusion(s): AB blood group is a risk factor for tuberculosis of a substantial magnitude in Africa and India.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2021 The Author(s)},

  abstract = {Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) using fluorescent proteins (FPs) as donors and acceptors is commonly used to microscopically image proteinprotein interactions in living cells. However, overlapping FP spectra lower signalto- noise because the FRET-sensitized acceptor emission signal is convoluted with donor bleedthrough and directly excited acceptor emission, or crosstalk. Quantitative FRET imaging is even more difficult when the local concentrations of donor-labeled and acceptor labeled proteins are substantially different. We used the well-studied interaction between FK binding protein 12 (FKBP12) and the rapamycin binding domain of m-Tor (FRB) as a model system to show that lanthanide-based biosensors can overcome the limitations of conventional FPFRET. The essential features of this approach include the use of luminescent Tb(III) complexes as FRET donors and the elimination of non-specific fluorescence background that comes from time-gated detection of long-lived (\textasciitilde ms) Tb(III) and Tb(III)-to-FP emission signals. We prepared stably transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblast lines that express a single polypeptide consisting of the following elements (N to C): 1) FRB; 2) Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR); 3) a linker sequence; 4) GFP; and 5) FKBP12. A Tb(III) complex (TMPLumi4) that selectively binds to eDHFR completes the sensor. The linker comprises alternating repeats of four glutamic acid residues followed by four arginine or lysine residues (ER/K) that form a rigid alpha helix in solution. Stochastic breaks in the helix permit close approach and binding of affinity elements positioned at each end. The effective concentration of each binding element depends on linker length and not solution concentration. Consequently, the fraction of two elements in the closed (high-FRET) state depends on KD and linker length. We tested constructs with ER/K linker lengths of 10, 20 and 30 nm. Following addition of cell permeable TMP-Lumi4 and rapamycin to culture medium, two-color, time-gated images showed significant, \textasciitilde 3-fold increases in acceptor denominated FRET ratios relative to baseline (without rapamycin). The high sensor dynamic range permitted robust, time-gated detection (Z'-factor {$>$} 0.8) of the FKBP12/FRB interaction and its inhibition by ascomycin in cells grown in 96-well plates.},

These limitations include linearity, homogeneity and stationarity. Agents in ABMs are autonomous entities, who interact with each other and with the environment. ABMs provide an inductive or `bottom-up' approach, i.e. individual-level behaviours define system-level components. ABMs have a unique property to capture emergence phenomena that otherwise cannot be predicted by the combination of individual-level interactions. In this tutorial, we discuss the basic concepts and important features of ABMs. We present a case study of an application of a simple ABM to evaluate the cost effectiveness of screening of an infectious disease. We also provide our model, which was developed using an open-source software program, NetLogo. We discuss software, resources, challenges and future research opportunities of ABMs for economic evaluations.},

However, the long-term impact of vaccination is difficult to predict due to uncertainty about the prevalence of HPV infection, pattern of sexual partnerships, progression of cervical neoplasias, accuracy of screening as well as the duration of infectiousness and immunity. Dynamic models of human papillomavirus (HPV) transmission were developed to describe the infection spread and development of cervical neoplasia, cervical cancer (squamous cell and adenocarcinoma) and anogenital warts. Using different combinations of assumptions, 9900 scenarios were created. Each scenario was then fitted to epidemiological data and the best-fitting scenarios used to predict the impact of vaccination. Results suggest that vaccinating 12-year-old girls at 80\% coverage will result in a 38-82\% reduction in cervical cancer incidence and 44-100\% reduction in anogenital warts incidence after 60 years of an ongoing vaccination programme if vaccine protection lasts 20 years on average. The marginal benefit of vaccinating boys depends on the degree of protection achieved by vaccinating girls.},

In the identity level, the authors use the multi-agent-based system and the mirror identity concept to describe identities with social network features such as daily visits, long-distance movement, high degree of clustering, low degree of separation and local clustering. The research will analyse the complex dynamic mathematic model of TB epidemic and determine its stability property by using the popular Matlab/Simulink software and relative software packages. Facing the current TB epidemic situation, the development of TB and its developing trend through constructing a dynamic bio-mathematical system model of TB is investigated. After simulating the development of epidemic situation with the solution of the SMIR epidemic model, the authors will come up with a good scheme to control epidemic situation to analyse the parameter values of a model that influence epidemic situation evolved. The authors will try to find the quarantining parameters that are the most important factors to control epidemic situation.

In this context, the surveillance and control plans may need to be re-evaluated, and understanding the dynamics of bTB spread within Spanish herds may help to develop new strategies for reducing the time for detection of infected herds and for the elimination of bTB from the herds already infected. Here, we developed a compartmental stochastic model to simulate bTB within-herd transmission, fed it with epidemiological data from 22 herds (obtained from a previous work) and carried out parameter inference using Approximate Bayesian Computing methods We also estimated the "Within-herd transmission potential Number" (Rh), i.e. the average number of secondary cases generated by a single animal infected introduced into a totally susceptible herd, considering different scenarios depending on the frequency of controls. The median global values obtained for the transmission parameters were: for the transmission coefficient (beta), 0.014 newly infected animals per infectious individual per day (i.e. 5.2 per year), for the rate at which infected individuals become infectious (alpha), 0.01 per day (equivalent to a latent period of 97 days), and for the rate at which infected individuals become reactive to the skin test (alpha1), 0.08 per day (equivalent to a period of 12 days for an infected animal to become reactive). However, the results also evidenced a great variability in the estimates of those parameters (in particular beta and alpha) among the 22 herds. Considering a 6-month interval between tests, the mean Rh was 0.23, increasing to 0.82 with an interval of 1 year, and to 2.01 and 3.47 with testing intervals of 2 and 4 years, respectively.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2018},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) remains as one of the world's deadliest infectious diseases despite the use of standardized antibiotic therapies. Recommended therapy for drug-susceptible TB is up to 6 months of antibiotics. Factors that contribute to lengthy regimens include antibiotic underexposure in lesions due to poor pharmacokinetics (PK) and complex granuloma compositions, but it is difficult to quantify how individual antibiotics are affected by these factors and to what extent these impact treatments. We use our next-generation multi-scale computational model to simulate granuloma formation and function together with antibiotic pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, allowing us to predict conditions leading to granuloma sterilization. In this work, we focus on how PK variability, determined from human PK data, and granuloma heterogeneity each quantitatively impact granuloma sterilization. We focus on treatment with the standard regimen for TB of four first-line antibiotics: isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. We find that low levels of antibiotic concentration due to naturally occurring PK variability and complex granulomas leads to longer granuloma sterilization times. Additionally, the ability of antibiotics to distribute in granulomas and kill different subpopulations of bacteria contributes to their specialization in the more efficacious combination therapy. These results can inform strategies to improve antibiotic therapy for TB.\textcopyright{} Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020 Cicchese, Dartois, Kirschner and Linderman.},

For computational modeling methodologies to mimic this biological complexity, individual scale models must be linked in ways that allow for dynamic exchange of information across scales. A powerful methodology is to combine a discrete modeling approach, agent-based models (ABMs), with continuum models to form hybrid models. Hybrid multi-scale ABMs have been used to simulate emergent responses of biological systems. Here, we review two aspects of hybrid multi-scale ABMs: linking individual scale models and efficiently solving the resulting model. We discuss the computational choices associated with aspects of linking individual scale models while simultaneously maintaining model tractability. We demonstrate implementations of existing numerical methods in the context of hybrid multi-scale ABMs. Using an example model describing Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, we show relative computational speeds of various combinations of numerical methods. Efficient linking and solution of hybrid multi-scale ABMs is key to model portability, modularity, and their use in understanding biological phenomena at a systems level.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2014, Biomedical Engineering Society.},

  abstract = {Biologically related processes operate across multiple spatiotemporal scales. For computational modeling methodologies to mimic this biological complexity, individual scale models must be linked in ways that allow for dynamic exchange of information across scales. A powerful methodology is to combine a discrete modeling approach, agent-based models (ABMs), with continuum models to form hybrid models. Hybrid multi-scale ABMs have been used to simulate emergent responses of biological systems. Here, we review two aspects of hybrid multi-scale ABMs: linking individual scale models and efficiently solving the resulting model. We discuss the computational choices associated with aspects of linking individual scale models while simultaneously maintaining model tractability. We demonstrate implementations of existing numerical methods in the context of hybrid multi-scale ABMs. Using an example model describing Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, we show relative computational speeds of various combinations of numerical methods. Efficient linking and solution of hybrid multi-scale ABMs is key to model portability, modularity, and their use in understanding biological phenomena at a systems level.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2014, Biomedical Engineering Society.}

  abstract = {Mycobacterial efflux pumps play a major role in the emergence of antimycobacterial drug resistance. Of particular interest is the proteinaceous multi-drug efflux pump protein Rv1258c that encodes a tetracycline/aminoglycoside resistance (TAP-2)-like efflux pump which is active in susceptible and drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Rv1258c is implicated in drug resistance to numerous antimycobacterials including first line drugs rifampicin and isoniazid as well as fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside antibiotic classes. To date, compounds like verapamil and piperine have been shown to inhibit Rv1258c but no direct evidence for binding or mode of action exist. Therefore in the present study we generated an accurate 3D model of Rv1258c using MODELLER and validated its structure using molecular dynamic simulation studies with GROMACS software. The 3D-structures of Rv1258c and the homologous template 1pw4 were simulated within a POPE/POPG lipid bilayer and found to behave similar. Another important finding was the identification of one local energy minima state of the apo protein, which speaks to the flexibility of the protein and will be investigated further. Extraction of one of the open channel conformations of Rv1258c and blind docking of various structurally diverse putative inhibitors and substrates, allowed for the identification of a probable binding site. Spectinamide was found to bind to a different location on the outside surface of the protein suggesting its ability to avoid the efflux channel. We further identified 246 putative compounds that showed higher binding affinity values to Rv1258c compared to piperine and verapamil. Interaction analysis of the top 20 purchasable compounds identified crucial hydrogen bond interactions with Ser26, Ser45 and Glu243 as well as a pi-pi stacking interaction with Trp32 that accounted for the strong affinity of these compounds for Rv1258c. Future studies will entail purchasing a number of compounds for in vitro activity testing against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2018 Cloete et al.

  abstract = {Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis leads to tuberculosis (TB) disease by one of the three possible routes: primary progression after a recent infection; re-activation of a latent infection; or exogenous re-infection of a previously infected individual. Recent studies show that optimal TB control strategies may vary depending on the predominant route to disease in a specific population. It is therefore important for public health policy makers to understand the relative frequency of each type of TB within specific epidemiological scenarios. Although molecular epidemiologic tools have been used to estimate the relative contribution of recent transmission and re-activation to the burden of TB disease, it is not possible to use these techniques to distinguish between primary disease and re-infection on a population level. Current estimates of the contribution of re-infection therefore rely on mathematical models which identify the parameters most consistent with epidemiological data; these studies find that exogenous re-infection is important only when TB incidence is high. A basic assumption of these models is that people in a population are all equally likely to come into contact with an infectious case. However, theoretical studies demonstrate that the social and spatial structure can strongly influence the dynamics of infectious disease transmission. Here, we use a network model of TB transmission to evaluate the impact of non-homogeneous mixing on the relative contribution of re-infection over realistic epidemic trajectories. In contrast to the findings of previous models, our results suggest that re-infection may be important in communities where the average disease incidence is moderate or low as the force of infection can be unevenly distributed in the population. These results have important implications for the development of TB control strategies. \textcopyright{} 2006 The Royal Society.},

This implementation study aims to demonstrate the feasibility and evaluate the effect of population-wide screening, treatment and prevention on TB and leprosy incidence rates, as well as TB transmission. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A non-randomised 'screen-and-treat' intervention conducted in the Pacific atoll of South Tarawa, Kiribati. Households are enumerated and all residents {$\geq$}3 years, as well as children {$<$}3 years with recent household exposure to TB or leprosy, invited for screening. Participants are screened using tuberculin skin testing, signs and symptoms of TB or leprosy, digital chest X-ray with computer-aided detection and sputum testing (Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra). Those diagnosed with disease are referred to the National TB and Leprosy Programme for management. Participants with TB infection are offered TB preventive treatment and those without TB disease or infection, or leprosy, are offered leprosy prophylaxis. The primary study outcome is the difference in the annual TB case notification rate before and after the intervention; a similar outcome is included for leprosy. The effect on TB transmission will be measured by comparing the estimated annual risk of TB infection in primary school children before and after the intervention, as a co-primary outcome used for power calculations. Comparison of TB and leprosy case notification rates in South Tarawa (the intervention group) and the rest of Kiribati (the control group) before, during and after the intervention is a secondary outcome. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approval was obtained from the University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (project no. 2021/127) and the Kiribati Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS). Findings will be shared with the MHMS and local communities, published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences.},

  abstract = {Introduction: In 2015, there was an increase in the number of asylum seekers arriving in Europe. Like in other countries, deciding screening priorities for tuberculosis (TB) and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was a challenge. At least five of 428 municipalities chose to screen asylum seekers for MRSA before TB; the Norwegian Institute for Public Health advised against this. Aim(s): To evaluate the MRSA/TB screening results from 2014 to 2016 and create a generalised framework for screening prioritisation in Norway through simulation modelling. Method(s): This is a register-based cohort study of asylum seekers using data from the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases from 2014 to 2016. We used survey data from municipalities that screened all asylum seekers for MRSA and denominator data from the Directorate of Immigration. A comparative risk assessment model was built to investigate the outcomes of prioritising between TB and MRSA in screening regimes. Result(s): Of 46,090 asylum seekers, 137 (0.30\%) were diagnosed with active TB (notification rate: 300/100,000 person-years). In the municipalities that screened all asylum seekers for MRSA, 13 of 1,768 (0.74\%) were found to be infected with MRSA. The model estimated that screening for MRSA would prevent eight MRSA infections while prioritising TB screening would prevent 24 cases of active TB and one death. Conclusion(s): Our findings support the decision to advise against screening for MRSA before TB among newly arrived asylum seekers. The model was an effective tool for comparing screening priorities and can be applied to other scenarios in other countries.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2019 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

  abstract = {Since December 2019, the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused world-wide turmoil in a short period of time, and the infection, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is spreading rapidly. AI-driven tools are used to identify Coronavirus outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread, where imaging techniques are widely used, such as CT scans and chest X-rays (CXRs). In this paper, motivated by the fact that X-ray imaging systems are more prevalent and cheaper than CT scan systems, a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which we call Truncated Inception Net, is proposed to screen COVID-19 positive CXRs from other non-COVID and/or healthy cases. To validate our proposal, six different types of datasets were employed by taking the following CXRs: COVID-19 positive, Pneumonia positive, Tuberculosis positive, and healthy cases into account. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 99.96\% (AUC of 1.0) in classifying COVID-19 positive cases from combined Pneumonia and healthy cases. Similarly, it achieved an accuracy of 99.92\% (AUC of 0.99) in classifying COVID-19 positive cases from combined Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, and healthy CXRs. To the best of our knowledge, as of now, the achieved results outperform the existing AI-driven tools for screening COVID-19 using the acquired CXRs, and proves the viability of using the proposed Truncated Inception Net as a screening tool.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020, Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Early clinical efficacy of novel antituberculosis drugs are evaluated in Early Bactericidal Activity (EBA) Phase 2A studies, quantifying bacterial kill in sputum of TB patients for up to 2 weeks monotherapy. As the first clinical efficacy studies, EBA trials have historically been used to determine the minimum effective dose. However, the lack of evidence linking EBA to treatment outcome has shifted their focus to be more "confirmatory" of preclinical efficacy. Here we investigate if EBA study metrics can be reliably predicted using preclinical PK/PD knowledge linked with clinical PK information. Method(s): Clinical PK models were linked to a previously-established translational mouse-to-human model1, consisting of "systems" parts describing bacterial growth, immune response, and drug-specific aspects (i.e. protein binding, concentration-effect relationships). Preclinical PKPD parameters were obtained by fitting a mechanistic model to PK-CFU data from BALB/c mouse models. Growth dynamics and bacterial kill were simulated in patients for rifampin, rifapentine, pyrazinamide, and isoniazid in NONMEM (v7.4). Relevant clinical PK covariates (e.g. sex, NAT2 acetylator status, food effects) were included. Calculated EBAs (decline in log CFU/mL/day) and 95\% prediction intervals were compared to reported literature EBAs. Result(s): This in silico approach confirmed positive clinical efficacy for all drugs and[95\% of all EBA results were within a 2.5-fold range of observed EBAs (Figure 1). Dose-response aspects of bacterial kill were well-preserved. Given EBA studies' small sample sizes, it was critical to account for covariate differences in simulations. Conclusion(s): A translational "mouse-to-human" model successfully predicted and confirmed early clinical efficacy for 4 major TB drugs from different classes. This tool, once further validated with novel drug classes, will offer an alternative approach to the efficacy component of EBA studies. Our work further confirms relevance of a mouse model linked with a mechanistic modeling platform as a key translational tool in TB drug development.},

  abstract = {Background Tuberculosis (TB) incidence in India continues to be high due, in large part, to long delays experienced by patients before successful diagnosis and treatment initiation, especially in the private sector. This diagnostic delay is driven by patients' inclination to switch between different types of providers and providers' inclination to delay ordering of accurate diagnostic tests relevant to TB. Our objective is to quantify the impact of changes in these behavioral characteristics of providers and patients on diagnostic delay experienced by pulmonary TB patients. Methods and findings We developed a discrete event simulation model of patients' diagnostic pathways that captures key behavioral characteristics of providers (time to order a test) and patients (time to switch to another provider). We used an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the parameters underlying these behavioral characteristics, with quantitative data encoded from detailed interviews of 76 and 64 pulmonary TB patients in the 2 Indian cities of Mumbai and Patna, respectively, which were conducted between April and August 2014. We employed the estimated model to simulate different counterfactual scenarios of diagnostic pathways under altered behavioral characteristics of providers and patients to predict their potential impact on the diagnostic delay. Private healthcare providers including chemists were the first point of contact for the majority of TB patients in Mumbai (70\%) and Patna (94\%). In Mumbai, 45\% of TB patients first approached less-than-fully-qualified providers (LTFQs), who take 28.71 days on average for diagnosis. About 61\% of these patients switched to other providers without a diagnosis. Our model estimates that immediate testing for TB by LTFQs at the first visit (at the current level of diagnostic accuracy) could reduce the average diagnostic delay from 35.53 days (95\% CI: 34.60, 36.46) to 18.72 days (95\% CI: 18.01, 19.43). In Patna, 61\% of TB patients first approached fully qualified providers (FQs), who take 9.74 days on average for diagnosis. Similarly, immediate testing by FQs at the first visit (at the current level of diagnostic accuracy) could reduce the average diagnostic delay from 23.39 days (95\% CI: 22.77, 24.02) to 11.16 days (95\% CI: 10.52, 11.81). Improving the diagnostic accuracy of providers per se, without reducing the time to testing, was not predicted to lead to any reduction in diagnostic delay. Our study was limited because of its restricted geographic scope, small sample size, and possible recall bias, which are typically associated with studies of patient pathways using patient interviews. Conclusions In this study, we found that encouraging private providers to order definitive TB diagnostic tests earlier during patient consultation may have substantial impact on reducing diagnostic delay in these urban Indian settings. These results should be combined with disease transmission models to predict the impact of changes in provider behavior on TB incidence.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020 Public Library of Science.

  abstract = {Objectives: Molecular tests show low sensitivity for smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). A screening and risk assessment system for smear-negative PTB using artificial neural networks (ANNs) based on patient signs and symptoms is proposed. Method(s): The prognostic and risk assessment models exploit a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and inspired adaptive resonance theory (iART) network. Model development considered data from 136 patients with suspected smear-negative PTB in a general hospital. Result(s): MLP showed higher sensitivity (100\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 78-100\%) than the other techniques, such as support vector machine (SVM) linear (86\%; 95\% CI 60-96\%), multivariate logistic regression (MLR) (79\%; 95\% CI 53-93\%), and classification and regression tree (CART) (71\%; 95\% CI 45-88\%). MLR showed a slightly higher specificity (85\%; 95\% CI 59-96\%) than MLP (80\%; 95\% CI 54-93\%), SVM linear (75\%, 95\% CI 49-90\%), and CART (65\%; 95\% CI 39-84\%). In terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the MLP model exhibited a higher value (0.918, 95\% CI 0.824-1.000) than the SVM linear (0.796, 95\% CI 0.651-0.970) and MLR (0.782, 95\% CI 0.663-0.960) models. The significant signs and symptoms identified in risk groups are coherent with clinical practice. Conclusion(s): In settings with a high prevalence of smear-negative PTB, the system can be useful for screening and also to aid clinical practice in expediting complementary tests for higher risk patients.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2016 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Background: Spatially-targeted approaches to screen for tuberculosis (TB) could accelerate TB control in high-burden populations. We aimed to estimate gains in case-finding yield under an adaptive decision-making approach for spatially-targeted, mobile digital chest radiography (dCXR)-based screening in communities with varying levels of TB prevalence. Method(s): We used a Monte-Carlo simulation model to simulate a spatially-targeted screening intervention in 24 communities with TB prevalence estimates derived from a large community-randomized trial. We implemented a Thompson sampling algorithm to allocate screening units based on Bayesian probabilities of local TB prevalence that are continuously updated during weekly screening rounds. Four mobile units for dCXR-based screening and subsequent Xpert Ultra-based testing were allocated among the communities during a 52-week period. We estimated the yield of bacteriologically-confirmed TB per 1000 screenings comparing scenarios of spatially-targeted and untargeted resource allocation. Result(s): We estimated that under the untargeted scenario, an expected 666 (95\% uncertainty interval 522-825) TB cases would be detected over one year, equivalent to 8.9 (7.5-10.3) per 1000 individuals screened. Allocating the screening units to the communities with the highest (prior-year) cases notification rates resulted in an expected 760 (617-926) TB cases detected, 10.1 (8.6-11.8) per 1000 screened. Adaptive, spatially-targeted screening resulted in an expected 1241 (995-1502) TB cases detected, 16.5 (14.5-18.7) per 1000 screened. Numbers of dCXR-based screenings needed to find detect one additional TB case declined during the first 12-14 weeks as a result of Bayesian learning. Conclusion(s): We introduce a spatially-targeted screening strategy that could reduce the number of screenings necessary to detect additional TB in high-burden settings and thus improve the efficiency of screening interventions.

  abstract = {In intra-EU trade, the health status of animals is warranted by issuing a health certificate after clinical inspection in the exporting country. This certificate cannot provide guarantee of absence of infection, especially not for diseases with a long incubation period and no overt clinical signs such as bovine tuberculosis (bTB). The Netherlands are officially free from bTB since 1999. However, frequent reintroductions occurred in the past 15 years through importation of infected cattle. Additional testing (AT) of imported cattle could enhance the probability of detecting an imported bTB infection in an early stage. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of risk-based AT for bTB in cattle imported into The Netherlands. A generic stochastic import risk model was developed that simulates introduction of infection into an importing country through importation of live animals. Main output parameters are the number of infected animals that is imported (Ninf), the number of infected animals that is detected by testing (Ndet), and the economic losses incurred by importing infected animals (loss). The model was parameterized for bTB. Model calculations were optimized to either maximize Ndet or to minimize loss. Model results indicate that the risk of bTB introduction into The Netherlands is very high. For the current situation in which Dutch health checks on imported cattle are limited to a clinical inspection of a random sample of 5-10\% of imported animals, the calculated annual Ninf=99 (median value). Random AT of 8\% of all imported cattle results in Ndet=7 (median value), while the median Ndet=75 if the sampling strategy for AT is optimized to maximize Ndet. However, in the latter scenario, loss is more than twice as large as in the current situation, because only calves are tested for which cost of detection is higher than the expected gain of preventing a possible outbreak. When optimizing the sampling strategy for AT to minimize loss, only breeding and production cattle are selected for AT resulting in Ndet=1 (median value). Loss is; however, reduced by 75\% if compared to the current situation. We conclude that the effectiveness of AT can greatly be improved by risk-based sampling. The optimal sampling strategy for risk-based AT for bTB is highly dependent on the objective of AT. If economic losses are to be contained, AT should focus on breeding and production cattle originating from high-risk countries.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background: Confirmation of a diagnosis of tuberculosis in children (aged {$<$}15 years) is challenging; under-reporting can result even when children do present to health services. Direct incidence estimates are unavailable, and WHO estimates build on paediatric notifications, with adjustment for incomplete surveillance by the same factor as adult notifications. We aimed to estimate the incidence of infection and disease in children, the prevalence of infection, and household exposure in the 22 countries with a high burden of the disease. Method(s): Within a mechanistic mathematical model, we combined estimates of adult tuberculosis prevalence in 2010, with aspects of the natural history of paediatric tuberculosis. In a household model, we estimated household exposure and infection. We accounted for the effects of age, BCG vaccination, and HIV infection. Additionally, we tested sensitivity to key structural assumptions by repeating all analyses without variation in BCG efficacy by latitude. Finding(s): The median number of children estimated to be sharing a household with an individual with infectious tuberculosis in 2010 was 15319701 (IQR 13766297-17061821). In 2010, the median number of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections in children was 7591759 (5800053-9969780), and 650977 children (424871-983118) developed disease. Cumulative exposure meant that the median number of children with latent infection in 2010 was 53234854 (41111669-68959804). The model suggests that 35\% (23-54) of paediatric cases of tuberculosis in the 15 countries reporting notifications by age in 2010 were detected. India is predicted to account for 27\% (22-33) of the total burden of paediatric tuberculosis in the 22 countries. The predicted proportion of tuberculosis burden in children for each country correlated with incidence, varying between 4\% and 21\%. Interpretation(s): Our model has shown that the incidence of paediatric tuberculosis is higher than the number of notifications, particularly in young children. Estimates of current household exposure and cumulative infection suggest an enormous opportunity for preventive treatment.

  abstract = {To reduce the incidence of tuberculosis, it is insufficient to simply understand the dynamics of tuberculosis transmission. Rather, we must design and rigorously evaluate interventions to halt transmission, prioritizing those interventions most likely to achieve population-level impact. Synergy in reducing tuberculosis transmission may be attainable by combining interventions that shrink the reservoir of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (preventive therapy), shorten the time between disease onset and treatment initiation (case finding and diagnosis), and prevent transmission in key settings, such as the built environment (infection control). In evaluating efficacy and estimating population-level impact, cluster-randomized trials and mechanistic models play particularly prominent roles. Historical and contemporary evidence suggests that effective public health interventions can halt tuberculosis transmission, but an evidence-based approach based on knowledge of local epidemiology is necessary for success. We provide a roadmap for designing, evaluating, and modeling interventions to interrupt the process of transmission that fuels a diverse array of tuberculosis epidemics worldwide.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2017 The Author.},

The aims of this study were to determine the relative importance of intra-group social interactions in the transmission of tuberculosis (TB; Mycobacterium bovis infection) in a population of wild meerkats (Suricata suricatta) in South Africa, and to use this information to propose an evidence-based intervention strategy to manage this disease. Detailed behavioural observations of all members of eight meerkat groups (n=134 individuals) were made over 24 months from January 2006 to December 2007. Social network analysis of three types of interaction (aggression, foraging competitions and grooming) revealed social structure to be very stable over time. Clustering of interactions was positively correlated with group size for both aggression (r=0.73) and grooming interactions (r=0.71), suggesting that infections may spread locally within clusters of interacting individuals but be limited from infecting all members of large groups by an apparent threshold in connections between different clusters. Repeated biological sampling every three months of all members of one social group (n=37 meerkats) was undertaken to quantify individual changes in M. bovis infection status. These empirical data were used to construct a dynamic network model of TB transmission within a meerkat group. The results indicated that grooming (both giving and receiving) was more likely than aggression to be correlated with M. bovis transmission and that groomers were at higher risk of infection than groomees. Intervention strategies for managing TB in meerkats that focus on those individuals engaging in the highest amount of grooming are therefore proposed. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Mathematical models, such as the Model for Assessment of Pediatric Interventions for TB (MAP-IT), a user-friendly, web-based, non-stochastic model, can be used to estimate the impact of TB interventions on pediatric TB-associated mortality. We used MAPIT to model scenarios of improved availability and utilization of single and packaged TB preventive, diagnostic, and treatment interventions to estimate the impact on pediatric TB-associated mortality in India and Nigeria, two high-burden countries, from 2017-2021. The current-care scenario estimated 276,800 and 82,500 TB-associated pediatric deaths from 2017-2021 in India and Nigeria, respectively. In India, interventions the greatest impact on pediatric mortality were improved pediatric fixed dose combination (FDC) regimes (15.2\%); improved clinical diagnosis (12.6\%); and improved contract tracing (2\%). In Nigeria, improved pediatric FDCs and clinical diagnosis had the greatest individual impact on pediatric mortality, with 8.7\% and 8.6\% reductions in pediatric mortality, respectively. Packaging TB interventions maximized the impact on pediatric TB mortality, with three-quarters of mortality prevented in both India and Nigeria. \textbackslash{} Improved pediatric FDCs and clinical diagnosis had the greatest individual impact on pediatric TB mortality. However, packaged TB interventions have the greatest impact on the number of lives saved. Intervention strategies must address obstacles to implementation, including service access, financing, availability of interventions, and education. In conclusion, MAP-IT estimates indicate packaged interventions including improved diagnostics and child-friendly FDCs regimens had the greatest impact on pediatric TB mortality in two high-burden countries.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological models are key tools for designing and evaluating detection and control strategies against animal infectious diseases. In France, after decades of decrease of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) incidence, the disease keeps circulating. Increasing prevalence levels are observed in several areas, where the detection and control strategy could be adapted. The objective of this work was to design and calibrate a model of the within-herd transmission of bTB. The proposed model is a stochastic model operating in discrete-time. Three health states were distinguished: susceptible, latent and infected. Dairy and beef herd dynamics and bTB detection and control programs were explicitly represented. Approximate Bayesian computation was used to estimate three model parameters from field data: the transmission parameter when animals are inside (betainside) and outside (betaoutside) buildings, and the duration of the latent phase. An independent dataset was used for model validation. The estimated median was 0.43 [0.16-0.84] month-1for betainsideand 0.08 [0.01-0.32] month-1for betaoutside. The median duration of the latent period was estimated 3.5 [2-8] months. The sensitivity analysis showed only minor influences of fixed parameter values on these posterior estimates. Validation based on an independent dataset showed that in more than 80\% of herds, the observed proportion of animals with detected lesions was between the 2.5\% and 97.5\% percentiles of the simulated distribution. In the absence of control program and once bTB has become enzootic within a herd, the median effective reproductive ratio was estimated to be 2.2 in beef herds and 1.7 in dairy herds. These low estimates are consistent with field observations of a low prevalence level in French bTB-infected herds.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2014 Bekara et al.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Targeted therapies are effective therapeutic approaches in advanced stages of NSCLC and require precise molecular profiling to identify oncogenic drivers. Differential diagnosis on a molecular level contributes to clinical decision making. Liquid biopsy (LB) use has demonstrated its potential to serve as an alternative to tissue biopsy (TB) particularly in cases where tissue sampling is not feasible or insufficient. We aimed at evaluating the cost-effectiveness of ctDNA-based LB use (molecular multigene testing) according to German care guidelines for metastatic NSCLC. Method(s): A Markov model was developed to compare the costs and clinical benefits associated with the use of LB as an add-on to TB according to the guidelines for NSCLC patients. Usual care TB served as comparator. A microsimulation model was used to simulate a cohort of non-squamous NSCLC patients stage IV. The parameters used for modelling were obtained from the literature and from the prospective German CRISP registry ("Clinical Research platform Into molecular testing, treatment, and outcome of non-Small cell lung carcinoma Patients"). For each pathway, average direct medical costs, and QALYs gained per patient were used for calculating incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Result(s): The use of LB as an add-on was costlier (144,981 vs. 144,587) but more effective measured in QALYs (1.20 vs. 1.19) for the care pathway of NSCLC patients (ICER 53,909/QALY). Cost-effectiveness was shown for EGFR-mutated patients (ICER -13,247/QALY). Conclusion(s): Including LB as an add-on into the care pathway of advanced NSCLC has positive clinical effects in terms of QALYs accompanied by a moderate cost-effectiveness.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of global mortality among communicable diseases. The diagnosis of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (DR-TB) demands even more attention, leading to longer treatments and higher deceased rates. All diagnostic methods available have deficiencies in their detection rates, time release results, or have a higher cost and need a complex infrastructure to setup. New molecular diagnostics, such as the Xpert MTB/RIF assay, have great potential for revolutionizing the diagnosis of Rifampicin Resistance (RR). But, a positive RR result with this test should be carefully interpreted and take into consideration the risk of Multidrug-Resistant TB (MDR-TB) according to its prevalence, locally. Therefore, the development of screening approaches for DR/MDR-TB suspects would help to identify those should be tested by Xpert MTB/RIF. This work develops Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models considering data from presumed DR/MDR-TB subjects according to the National Guidelines at Rio de Janeiro/Brazil, attended in reference centers in Rio de Janeiro, from Feb 2011 and May 2013. Subjects aged 18 years or older, and results were compared with models based on Classification And Regression Trees (CART). Practical operation at different epidemiological scenarios are considered by constructing models using different variable selection criteria, so that environments with low resource conditions can be assisted. Among 280 presumed DR-TB cases included, 38 were DR-TB, 48-MDR, 32-Drug-Sensitive and 162 with no TB. Between DR-TB and non DR-TB, the sensitivity and specificity reached 95.1\%(+/-5.0) and 85.0\%(+/-4.9), respectively. The promising results of clinical score for DR/MDR-TB diagnosis indicate that this approach may be used in the evaluation of presumed DR/MDR-TB.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Paratuberculosis is a worldwide disease mainly introduced through trade. Due to the low sensitivity of diagnostic tests, it is difficult to protect herds from purchasing infected animals. Our objective was to assess if rewiring trade networks to promote risk-based movements could reduce the spread of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) between dairy cattle herds at a regional scale. Two levels of control strategies were assessed. At the between-herd scale, trade rewiring aimed to prevent animals from high-risk herds moving into low-risk herds. At the within-herd scale, complementary additional measures were considered based on the herd infection status, aiming to limit the within-herd spread by reducing calf exposure to adult faeces and culling more rapidly after positive test results. We used a stochastic individual-based and between-herd mechanistic epidemiological model adapted to the 12,857 dairy cattle herds located in Brittany, western France. We compared the regional spread of MAP using observed trade movements against a rewiring algorithm rendering trade movements risk-based. All females over two years old were tested. Based on the results, and taking into account the low test sensitivity, herds were annually assigned one of three statuses: A if the estimated true prevalence was below 7\%, B if it ranged from 7 to 21 \%, C otherwise. We also identified herds with a high probability of being MAP-free (AAA herds that had obtained an A status over three consecutive years) to assess the effect of decreasing their risk of purchasing infected animals on MAP regional spread. We showed that movement rewiring to prevent the sale of animals from high to low-prevalence herds reduces MAP regional spread. Targeting AAA herds made it possible to minimize the control effort to decrease MAP regional spread. However, animals purchased by AAA herds should have a moderate to high probability of being MAP-free, especially if the risk of purchasing animals from herds of unknown status cannot be managed. Improved hygiene and early culling of positive animals were relevant complementary on-farm control options to further decrease MAP spread. Future studies should identify how to define herd statuses to target optimal control measure combinations that could reduce the spread of MAP on a regional scale most effectively.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2021 The Authors},

The models predict that a pandemic in the United Kingdom would peak within two to three months of the first case, and be over within 4 months. It also shows that vaccines need to be available within two months of the start of a pandemic to have a big effect in reducing infection rates. That means that vaccines would need to be stockpiled in advance to be effective.},

  abstract = {Background: Variation in host attributes that influence their contact rates and infectiousness can lead some individuals to make disproportionate contributions to the spread of infections. Understanding the roles of such 'superspreaders' can be crucial in deciding where to direct disease surveillance and controls to greatest effect. In the epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in Great Britain, it has been suggested that a minority of cattle farms or herds might make disproportionate contributions to the spread of Mycobacterium bovis, and hence might be considered 'superspreader farms'. Objectives and Methods: We review the literature to identify the characteristics of farms that have the potential to contribute to exceptional values in the three main components of the farm reproductive number - Rf: contact rate, infectiousness and duration of infectiousness, and therefore might characterize potential superspreader farms for bovine tuberculosis in Great Britain. Result(s): Farms exhibit marked heterogeneity in contact rates arising from between-farm trading of cattle. A minority of farms act as trading hubs that greatly augment connections within cattle trading networks. Herd infectiousness might be increased by high within-herd transmission or the presence of supershedding individuals, or infectiousness might be prolonged due to undetected infections or by repeated local transmission, via wildlife or fomites. Conclusion(s): Targeting control methods on putative superspreader farms might yield disproportionate benefits in controlling endemic bovine tuberculosis in Great Britain. However, real-time identification of any such farms, and integration of controls with industry practices, present analytical, operational and policy challenges.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020 The Authors.

  abstract = {Some infectious diseases, such as influenza, tuberculosis, and SARS-CoV-2, may be transmitted when virus-laden particles expelled from an infectious person are inhaled by someone else, which is known as the airborne transmission route. These virus-laden particles are more concentrated in the expiratory jet of an infectious person than elsewhere in a well-mixed room, but this near-field enhancement in virion exposure has not been well quantified. Transmission of airborne viruses depends on factors that are inherently variable and, in many cases, poorly constrained, and quantifying this uncertainty requires large ensembles of model simulations that span the variability in input parameters. However, models that are well-suited to simulate the near-field evolution of respiratory particles are also computationally expensive, which limits the exploration of parametric uncertainty. In order to perform many simulations that span the wide variability in factors governing airborne transmission, we developed the Quadrature-based model of Respiratory Aerosol and Droplets (QuaRAD). QuaRAD is an efficient framework for simulating the evolution of virus-laden particles after they are expelled from an infectious person, their deposition to the nasal cavity of a susceptible person, and the subsequent risk of initial infection. We simulated 10 000 scenarios to quantify the risk of initial infection by a particular virus, SARS-CoV-2. The predicted risk of infection was highly variable among scenarios and, in each scenario, was strongly enhanced near the infectious individual. In more than 50\% of scenarios, the physical distancing needed to avoid near-field enhancements in airborne transmission was beyond the recommended safe distance of two meters (six feet) if the infectious person is not wearing a mask, though this distance defining the near-field extent was also highly variable among scenarios; the variability in the near-field extent is explained predominantly by variability in expiration velocity. Our findings suggest that maintaining at least two meters of distance from an infectious person greatly reduces exposure to airborne virions; protections against airborne transmission, such as N95 respirators, should be available when distancing is not possible.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2021 The Authors.

  abstract = {The Netherlands holds the bovine tuberculosis-free (BTB-free) status according to European Union standards, but in recent years small outbreaks of the infection have occurred. After the last outbreak in 1999 with 10 infected herds the question raised if the current surveillance system, visual inspection of carcasses at the slaughterhouse, is efficient enough to detect infected cattle in time and to maintain the official BTB-free status. Through epidemiological modelling, the risk of a major outbreak is quantified, using one of six surveillance strategies. These are the currently used visual inspection of carcasses at the slaughterhouse (SL), the ELISA test on blood samples of carcasses at the slaughterhouse (ELISA-B), the gamma-interferon test on blood samples of carcasses at the slaughterhouse (GAMMA-B), comparative tuberculination of the herd (CT), the combined method of single and comparative tuberculination of the herd (ST + CT) and the ELISA test on samples of bulk milk (ELISA-M). Test frequency of the last three methods was varied as well. A stochastic individual based model (IBM) was developed to simulate a chain of infected herds, where each individual animal is followed in time. The model mimics the nation-wide situation after the introduction of one infected animal into one herd. BTB-transmission is simulated with an S-E1-E 2-I state transition model. Output is time until detection of the infection, prevalence in the detected herd and the number of infected herds at the time of detection. For the assessment 500 simulations were used, representing 500 BTB-introductions. Model robustness to parameter values was analysed with Monte Carlo elasticity analysis, for which 1000 simulations were used. Results of median time until detection and median number of infected farms at detection for SL (302 weeks and seven farms) were in agreement with estimates from an outbreak in the Netherlands in 1999. ELISA-B and GAMMA-B performed better than SL with a much lower median time until detection (189 and 97 weeks, respectively). The results for the tuberculination methods (ST + CT and CT) and ELISA-M depended heavily on the frequency in which the tests were performed. The tuberculination methods ST + CT and CT yield comparable results and detect the infection sooner than SL, also at the lowest tested frequency of once in 5 years. ELISA-M is comparable with SL at frequencies of once in 4 or 5 years, and this test works well at frequencies of once a year or higher. Our study results are used for an economical optimisation analysis of the six surveillance strategies. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Standard treatment for active tuberculosis (TB) requires drug treatment with at least four drugs over six months. Shorter-duration therapy would mean less need for strict adherence, and reduced risk of bacterial resistance. A system pharmacology model of TB infection, and drug therapy was developed and used to simulate the outcome of different drug therapy scenarios. The model incorporated human immune response, granuloma lesions, multi-drug antimicrobial chemotherapy, and bacterial resistance. A dynamic population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) simulation model including rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol was developed and parameters aligned with previous experimental data. Population therapy outcomes for simulations were found to be generally consistent with summary results from previous clinical trials, for a range of drug dose and duration scenarios. An online tool developed from this model is released as open source software. The TB simulation tool could support analysis of new therapy options, novel drug types, and combinations, incorporating factors such as patient adherence behavior.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020 Fors et al.

  abstract = {Online activity-based data can be used to aid infectious disease forecasting. Our aim was to exploit the converging nature of the tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes epidemics to forecast TB case numbers. Thus, we extended TB prediction models based on traditional data with diabetes-related Google searches. We obtained data on the weekly case numbers of TB in Germany from June 8th, 2014, to May 5th, 2019. Internet search data were obtained from a Google Trends (GTD) search for 'diabetes' to the corresponding interval. A seasonal autoregressive moving average (SARIMA) model (0,1,1) (1,0,0) [52] was selected to describe the weekly TB case numbers with and without GTD as an external regressor. We cross-validated the SARIMA models to obtain the root mean squared errors (RMSE). We repeated this procedure with autoregressive feed-forward neural network (NNAR) models using 5-fold cross-validation. To simulate a data-poor surveillance setting, we also tested traditional and GTD-extended models against a hold-out dataset using a decreased 52-week-long period with missing values for training. Cross-validation resulted in an RMSE of 20.83 for the traditional model and 18.56 for the GTD-extended model. Cross-validation of the NNAR models showed a mean RMSE of 19.49 for the traditional model and 18.99 for the GTD-extended model. When we tested the models trained on a decreased dataset with missing values, the GTD-extended models achieved significantly better prediction than the traditional models (p {$<$} 0.001). The GTD-extended models outperformed the traditional models in all assessed model evaluation parameters. Using online activity-based data regarding diabetes can improve TB forecasting, but further validation is warranted.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

For Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, where antigen-specific CD4+ T cell derived IFN-gamma is essential, such a loss can lead to a significant failure to control infection. The present paper develops a mathematical model of infection with M. tuberculosis in old mice. The model includes an early resistance to infection which is mediated by CD8+ T cells. A subsequent reversal of this phenotype results from the slow generation of CD4+ T cell mediated immunity in old age. The model simulations corroborate experimental data and hence, the model was used to test whether immunity to infection could be improved in old mice, if CD4+ T cell responses were enhanced. Our simulations indicate that boosting antigen presentation and T cell proliferation can decrease the M. tuberculosis burden in the lung. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background: HIV programmes face challenges achieving high rates of HIV testing and treatment needed to optimise health and to reduce transmission. We used data from the Botswana Combination Prevention Project study survey to assess Botswana's progress toward achieving UNAIDS targets for 2020: 90\% of all people living with HIV knowing their status, 90\% of these receiving sustained antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 90\% of those having virological suppression (90-90-90). Method(s): A population-based sample of individuals was recruited and interviewed in 30 rural and periurban communities from Oct 30, 2013, to Nov 24, 2015, as part of a large, ongoing community-randomised trial designed to assess the effect of a combination prevention package on HIV incidence. A random sample of about 20\% of households in each community was selected. Consenting household residents aged 16-64 years who were Botswana citizens or spouses of citizens responded to a questionnaire and had blood drawn for HIV testing in the absence of documentation of positive HIV status. Viral load testing was done in all HIV-infected participants, irrespective of treatment status. We used modified Poisson generalised estimating equations to obtain prevalence ratios, corresponding Huber robust SEs, and 95\% Wald CIs to examine associations between individual sociodemographic factors and a binary outcome indicating achievement of the three individual and combined overall 90-90-90 targets. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01965470. Finding(s): 81\% of enumerated eligible household members took part in the survey (10\% refused and 9\% were absent). Among 12 610 participants surveyed, 3596 (29\%) were infected with HIV, and 2995 (83.3\%, 95\% CI 81.4-85.2) of these individuals already knew their HIV status. Among those who knew their HIV status, 2617 (87.4\%, 95\% CI 85.8-89.0) were receiving ART (95\% of those eligible by national guidelines, and 73\% of all infected people). Of the 2609 individuals receiving ART with a viral load measurement, 2517 (96.5\%, 95\% CI 96.0-97.0) had viral load of 400 copies per mL or less. Overall, 70.2\% (95\% CI 67.5-73.0) of HIV-infected people had virological suppression, close to the UNAIDS target of 73\%. Interpretation(s): UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets are achievable even in resource-constrained settings with high HIV burden.

Models are often used to calculate the expected course of events in the absence of more formal assessments. They are also used to derive estimates of rare or future events from recorded intermediate points. When developing models, decisions are needed about the appropriate level of complexity to be represented and about model structure and assumptions. The degree of rigor in model development and assessment can vary greatly, and there is a danger that existing beliefs inappropriately influence judgments about model assumptions and results.},

  abstract = {The post genomic era has provided the leap into the quantitative biology and introduced biologists into the 'omes' and 'ics' world. For biologists, it is utmost important to know the biology of disease and the mechanism of action of medicines. But no longer are these contained in the domain of physiology and medicinal chemistry. The importance of reorganizing our thinking process is mostly reflected in the merger and acquisition of Biotechnology, Bioinformatics and Chemoinformatics companies by/with large pharmaceutical companies recently. The development in the field of molecular modeling and simulation has played the leading role in the drug design technology in pharmaceutical industry. Starting from Genomics, alignment of genes of interest amongst the species, three-dimensional structure prediction from the knowledge of sequence of amino acids, prediction of active sites, searching for lead compounds using database and structure-based design, prediction of binding efficiency prior to the experiment and lead optimization using physico-chemical properties of the compounds are a few to cite. One such case study using in silico attempt towards the designing from known antituberculosis chemicals a set of novel inhibitor and finding the drug target(s) using pathway simulation and analysis (Prakash \& Ghosh, 2006; Singh \& Ghosh, 2006; Vinekar \& Ghosh, 2009) will be discussed in brief. Recent news has warned the medical community that war against pathogenic bacteria is yet not over, repeated breaking of different drug resistance in different ranges of pathogen has been observed in the patient, especially in developing and underdeveloped countries. Many researchers, probably the next to cancer are experimentally using many prong attack on the understanding the mechanism and developing new strategy of inhibitors for combating this phenomena, resurging XDR, MDR, PDR. The extensive discussion to define these classes is available in the literature (Diacon, 2014; Iseman, 1993; Koser et al. 2015; Magiorakos, 2011). Research work engaging with clinician, epidemiologist, biologists, microbiologist, etc. in this field is emerging to highlight the complexity of the problem. However, many chemicals have been developed to combat the MDR/XDR Tb yet not been fully successful for a long time. Tuberculii, bacteria have shown to have multiple spontaneous mutations at a predictable rate and independent of different drug administrations. Such phenomena are prevalent to many bacterial and more common to viral disease which leads researchers to develop multiple target drug designing. Present discussion will open up the future of understanding of disease, its inter relationship within biochemical pathway and effect of protein-protein interaction identified as target for combating persistence stage in bacteria.},

  abstract = {Metalloproteins form a major class of enzymes in the living system that are involved in crucial biological functions such as catalysis, redox reactions and as 'switches' in signal transductions. Iron dependent repressor (IdeR) is a metal-sensing transcription factor that regulates free iron concentration in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. IdeR is also known to promote bacterial virulence, making it an important target in the field of therapeutics. Mechanistic details of how iron ions modulate IdeR such that it dimerizes and binds to DNA is not understood clearly. In this study, we have performed molecular dynamic simulations and integrated it with protein structure networks to study the influence of iron on IdeR structure and function. A significant structural variation between the metallated and the non-metallated system is observed. Our simulations clearly indicate the importance of iron in stabilizing its monomeric subunit, which in turn promotes dimerization. However, the most striking results are obtained from the simulations of IdeR-DNA complex in the absence of metals, where at the end of 100ns simulations, the protein subunits are seen to rapidly dissociate away from the DNA, thereby forming an excellent resource to investigate the mechanism of DNA binding. We have also investigated the role of iron as an allosteric regulator of IdeR that positively induces IdeR-DNA complex formation. Based on this study, a mechanistic model of IdeR activation and DNA binding has been proposed.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2015 Ghosh et al.},

Although its transmission pathways remain poorly understood, the disease's distribution was previously modelled statistically by using environmental variables and measures of their seasonality. Movements of infected animals have long been considered a critical factor in the spread of livestock diseases, as reflected in strict import/export regulations, the extensive movement restrictions imposed during the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, the tracing procedures after a new case of BTB has been confirmed and the Government's recently published strategic framework for the sustainable control on BTB. Since January 2001 it has been mandatory for stock-keepers in Great Britain to notify the British Cattle Movement Service of all cattle births, movements and deaths. Here we show that movements as recorded in the Cattle Tracing System data archive, and particularly those from areas where BTB is reported, consistently outperform environmental, topographic and other anthropogenic variables as the main predictor of disease occurrence. Simulation distribution models for 2002 and 2003, incorporating all predictor categories, are presented and used to project distributions for 2004 and 2005.},

  abstract = {The availability of DNA fingerprinting techniques for Mycobacterium tuberculosis has led to attempts to estimate the extent of recent transmission in populations, using the assumption that groups of tuberculosis patients with identical isolates ('clusters') are likely to reflect recently acquired infections. It is never possible to include all cases of tuberculosis in a given population in a study, and the proportion of isolates found to be clustered will depend on the completeness of the sampling. Using stochastic simulation models based on real and hypothetical populations, the authors demonstrate the influence of incomplete sampling on the estimates of clustering obtained. The results show that as the sampling fraction increases, the proportion of isolates identified as clustered also increases and the variance of the estimated proportion clustered decreases. Cluster size is also important: the underestimation of clustering for any given sampling fraction is greater, and the variability in the results obtained is larger, for populations with small clusters than for those with the same number of individuals arranged in large clusters. A considerable amount of caution should be used in interpreting the results of studies on clustering of M. tuberculosis isolates, particularly when sampling fractions are small.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in treatment success rates for tuberculosis (TB), current six-month regimen duration remains a challenge for many National TB Programmes, health systems, and patients. There is increasing investment in the development of shortened regimens with a number of candidates in phase 3 trials. METHODS: We developed an individual-based decision analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical four-month regimen for first-line treatment of TB, assuming non-inferiority to current regimens of six-month duration. The model was populated using extensive, empirically-collected data to estimate the economic impact on both health systems and patients of regimen shortening for first-line TB treatment in South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, and Tanzania. We explicitly considered 'real world' constraints such as sub-optimal guideline adherence. RESULTS: From a societal perspective, a shortened regimen, priced at USD1 per day, could be a cost-saving option in South Africa, Brazil, and Tanzania, but would not be cost-effective in Bangladesh when compared to one gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Incorporating 'real world' constraints reduces cost-effectiveness. Patient-incurred costs could be reduced in all settings. From a health service perspective, increased drug costs need to be balanced against decreased delivery costs. The new regimen would remain a cost-effective option, when compared to each countries' GDP per capita, even if new drugs cost up to USD7.5 and USD53.8 per day in South Africa and Brazil; this threshold was above USD1 in Tanzania and under USD1 in Bangladesh. CONCLUSION: Reducing the duration of first-line TB treatment has the potential for substantial economic gains from a patient perspective. The potential economic gains for health services may also be important, but will be context-specific and dependent on the appropriate pricing of any new regimen.},

Objectives To estimate the ability and costs of testing and treatment for LTBI to reach pre-elimination and elimination targets in California. Methods We created an individual-based epidemic model of TB, calibrated to historical cases. We evaluated the effects of increased testing (QuantiFERON-TB Gold) and treatment (three months of isoniazid and rifapentine). We analyzed four test and treat targeting strategies: (1) individuals with medical risk factors (MRF), (2) non-USB, (3) both non-USB and MRF, and (4) all Californians. For each strategy, we estimated the effects of increasing test and treat by a factor of 2, 4, or 10 from the base case. We estimated the number of TB cases occurring and prevented, and net and incremental costs from 2017 to 2065 in 2015 U.S. dollars. Efficacy, costs, adverse events, and treatment dropout were estimated from published data. We estimated the cost per case averted and per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Measurements and main results In the base case, 106,000 TB cases are predicted to 2065. Pre-elimination was achieved by 2065 in three scenarios: a 10-fold increase in the non-USB and persons with MRF (by 2052), and 4- or 10-fold increase in all Californians (by 2058 and 2035, respectively). TB elimination was not achieved by any intervention scenario. The most aggressive strategy, 10-fold in all Californians, achieved a case rate of 8 (95\% UI 4-16) per million by 2050. Of scenarios that reached pre-elimination, the incremental net cost was \$20 billion (non-USB and MRF) to \$48 billion. These had an incremental cost per QALY of \$657,000 to \$3.1 million. A more efficient but somewhat less effective single-lifetime test strategy reached as low as \$80,000 per QALY. Conclusions Substantial gains can be made in TB control in coming years by scaling-up current testing and treatment in non-USB and those with medical risks.Copyright This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

  abstract = {Coinfecting parasites and pathogens remain a leading challenge for global public health due to their consequences for individual-level infection risk and disease progression. However, a clear understanding of the population-level consequences of coinfection is lacking. Here, we constructed a model that includes three individual-level effects of coinfection: mortality, fecundity, and transmission. We used the model to investigate how these individual-level consequences of coinfection scale up to produce population-level infection patterns. To parameterize this model, we conducted a 4-y cohort study in African buffalo to estimate the individual-level effects of coinfection with two bacterial pathogens, bovine tuberculosis (bTB) and brucellosis, across a range of demographic and environmental contexts. At the individual level, our empirical results identified bTB as a risk factor for acquiring brucellosis, but we found no association between brucellosis and the risk of acquiring bTB. Both infections were associated with reductions in survival and neither infection was associated with reductions in fecundity. The model reproduced coinfection patterns in the data and predicted opposite impacts of coinfection at individual and population scales: Whereas bTB facilitated brucellosis infection at the individual level, our model predicted the presence of brucellosis to have a strong negative impact on bTB at the population level. In modeled populations where brucellosis was present, the endemic prevalence and basic reproduction number (R0) of bTB were lower than in populations without brucellosis. Therefore, these results provide a data-driven example of competition between coinfecting pathogens that occurs when one pathogen facilitates secondary infections at the individual level.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

We use a previously described mathematical model to explore how the HIV-1 epidemic could develop within a sub-Saharan African context and investigate the trends and patterns of adult mortality which could follow. Two contrasting scenarios are studied, one which turns population growth rates negative and another which does not. In both cases, HIV-1-related disease accounts for over 75\% of annual deaths among men and women aged 15- 60 years by year 25 of the epidemic. Relatively little change in mortality is seen in the early years of the simulated epidemics. However, by year 15, expectation of life at age 15 has fallen from 50 to below 30 years. The fragmentary evidence now available from empirical studies supports the impression that HIV-1 is rapidly emerging as a leading cause of adult deaths in areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Observed patterns of age-dependent mortality reflect those projected in the model simulations.},

  abstract = {The persistence of bovine TB (bTB) in various countries throughout the world is enhanced by the existence of wildlife hosts for the infection. In Britain and Ireland, the principal wildlife host for bTB is the badger (Meles meles). The objective of our study was to examine the dynamics of bTB in badgers in relation to both badger-derived infection from within the population and externally-derived, trickle-type, infection, such as could occur from other species or environmental sources, using a spatial stochastic simulation model. The presence of external sources of infection can increase mean prevalence and reduce the threshold group size for disease persistence. Above the threshold equilibrium group size of 6-8 individuals predicted by the model for bTB persistence in badgers based on internal infection alone, external sources of infection have relatively little impact on the persistence or level of disease. However, within a critical range of group sizes just below this threshold level, external infection becomes much more important in determining disease dynamics. Within this critical range, external infection increases the ratio of intra- to inter-group infections due to the greater probability of external infections entering fully-susceptible groups. The effect is to enable bTB persistence and increase bTB prevalence in badger populations which would not be able to maintain bTB based on internal infection alone. External sources of bTB infection can contribute to the persistence of bTB in badger populations. In high-density badger populations, internal badger-derived infections occur at a sufficient rate that the additional effect of external sources in exacerbating disease is minimal. However, in lower-density populations, external sources of infection are much more important in enhancing bTB prevalence and persistence. In such circumstances, it is particularly important that control strategies to reduce bTB in badgers include efforts to minimise such external sources of infection.},

In the UK and Ireland, efforts to control TB through culling of badgers (Meles meles), the principal wildlife host, have failed and there is significant interest in vaccination of badgers as an alternative or complementary strategy. Using a simulation model, we show that where TB is self-contained within the badger population and there are no external sources of infection, limited-duration vaccination at a high level of efficacy can reduce or even eradicate TB from the badger population. However, where sources of external infection persist, benefits in TB reduction in badgers can only be achieved by ongoing, annual vaccination. Vaccination is likely to be most effective as part of an integrated disease management strategy incorporating a number of different approaches across the entire host community.

An adapted quality assessment tool was developed, with a resulting median study quality score of 20/28. The literature remains divided as to whether vaccines effective pre- or post-infection would provide greatest epidemiological impact. However, all-age or adolescent/adult targeted prevention of disease vaccines achieve greater and more rapid impact than neonatal vaccines. Mass campaigns alongside routine neonatal vaccination can have profound additional impact. Economic evaluations found TB vaccines overwhelmingly cost-effective, particularly when targeted to adolescents/adults. The variability of impact by setting, age group and vaccine characteristics must be accounted for in the development and delivery of future TB vaccines.},

  abstract = {Individual-based models (IBMs) informing public health policy should be calibrated to data and provide estimates of uncertainty. Two main components of model-calibration methods are the parameter-search strategy and the goodness-of-fit (GOF) measure; many options exist for each of these. This review provides an overview of calibration methods used in IBMs modelling infectious disease spread. We identified articles on PubMed employing simulation- based methods to calibrate IBMs informing public health policy in HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria epidemiology published between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2018. Articles were included if models stored individual-specific information, and calibration involved comparing model output to population-level targets. We extracted information on parameter- search strategies, GOF measures, and model validation. The PubMed search identified 653 candidate articles, of which 84 met the review criteria. Of the included articles, 40 (48\%) combined a quantitative GOF measure with an algorithmic parameter-search strategy- either an optimisation algorithm (14/40) or a sampling algorithm (26/40). These 40 articles varied widely in their choices of parameter-search strategies and GOF measures. For the remaining 44 (52\%) articles, the parameter-search strategy could either not be identified (32/44) or was described as an informal, non-reproducible method (12/44). Of these 44 articles, the majority (25/44) were unclear about the GOF measure used; of the rest, only five quantitatively evaluated GOF. Only a minority of the included articles, 14 (17\%) provided a rationale for their choice of model-calibration method. Model validation was reported in 31 (37\%) articles. Reporting on calibration methods is far from optimal in epidemiological modelling studies of HIV, malaria and TB transmission dynamics. The adoption of better documented, algorithmic calibration methods could improve both reproducibility and the quality of inference in model-based epidemiology. There is a need for research comparing the performance of calibration methods to inform decisions about the parameter-search strategies and GOF measures.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020 Hazelbag et al.},

  abstract = {Background and objectives Diagnosis of Pulmonary Rifampicin Resistant Tuberculosis (RR-TB) with the Drug-Susceptibility Test (DST) is costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, GeneXpert for rapid diagnosis is not widely available in Indonesia. This study aims to develop and evaluate the CUHASROBUST model performance, an artificial-intelligence-based RR-TB screening tool. Methods A cross-sectional study involved suspected all type of RR-TB patients with complete sputum Lowenstein Jensen DST (reference) and 19 clinical, laboratory, and radiology parameter results, retrieved from medical records in hospitals under the Faculty of Medicine, Hasanuddin University Indonesia, from January 2015-December 2019. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were built along with other classifiers. The model was tested on participants recruited from January 2020-October 2020 and deployed into CUHAS-ROBUST (index test) application. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were obtained for assessment. Results A total of 487 participants (32 Multidrug-Resistant/MDR 57 RR-TB, 398 drug-sensitive) were recruited for model building and 157 participants (23 MDR and 21 RR) in prospective testing. The ANN full model yields the highest values of accuracy (88\% (95\% CI 85-91)), and sensitivity (84\% (95\% CI 76-89)) compare to other models that show sensitivity below 80\% (Logistic Regression 32\%, Decision Tree 44\%, Random Forest 25\%, Extreme Gradient Boost 25\%). However, this ANN has lower specificity among other models (90\% (95\% CI 86-93)) where Logistic Regression demonstrates the highest (99\% (95\% CI 97-99)). This ANN model was selected for the CUHAS-ROBUST application, although still lower than the sensitivity of global GeneXpert results (87.5\%). Conclusion The ANN-CUHAS ROBUST outperforms other AI classifiers model in detecting all type of RR-TB, and by deploying into the application, the health staff can utilize the tool for screening purposes particularly at the primary care level where the GeneXpert examination is not available.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2021 Herman et al.

  abstract = {Concerns have been raised about whether the interaction between tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may lead worldwide to a recrudescent tuberculosis pandemic. These concerns are particularly grave in Africa which has a high prevalence of both tuberculosis and HIV. This study used a computer simulation model to examine the effect of tuberculosis-HIV interactions on tuberculosis prevalence and mortality in Africa. The model then assessed the impact of expanding treatment and chemoprophylaxis programmes on tuberculosis prevalence and mortality over the next decade. In communities where 20\% of the population is infected with HIV and 25\% receive treatment for tuberculosis, deaths from tuberculosis would be 100\% higher than in communities where none of the population is HIV-infected. In a population the size of Uganda's, during one decade there would be approximately an additional 530 000 deaths from tuberculosis. When 50\% of patients with active tuberculosis receive treatment, one death will be averted for every 2.5 people who receive treatment. The prevalence of active tuberculosis could be cut by over 90\% in a decade by providing effective chemoprophylaxis to 30\% of individuals with inactive TB. In conclusion TB is only one example of a preventable and treatable infectious disease which can be spread through casual contact and which, because of its higher prevalence among the HIV positive population, may lead to a preventable increase in incidence of infection among the general population.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Tuberculosis (TB) control programs have been less successful among children than among adults in the United States. Between 1992 and 1997, the rate of decline of TB cases among 0- to 14-year-old children was less than the rate of decline among any other age group of US-born persons. Because of the higher prevalence of active TB among adults and their higher infectivity, most programs for TB in the United States have targeted adults. The inherent assumption has been that by targeting adults, from whom children may become infected, TB morbidity and mortality among children also will be reduced effectively. METHOD(S): Using a semi-Markov model that divided the US population into age groups {$<$}15 years old and {$>$}/=15 years old and into 18 clinical states based on the risk for or presence of TB and human immunodeficiency virus infection, we developed a computer-based simulation model to examine the effect of a range of potential TB control strategies on projected TB cases and deaths in children. We compare the impact of interventions targeted at children with the impact of interventions targeted at adults on pediatric morbidity and mortality. RESULT(S): After 10 years, a 5\% increase in the number of adults with TB who enter treatment would only lead to a.05\% decline in TB cases among children, compared with predicted cases without this intervention. Improving treatment efficacy among those adults who are already receiving treatment for their TB leads to a smaller decline in cases among children of only.003\%. In contrast, a 5\% increase in the number of children who enter treatment leads to a 25\% decline, after 10 years, in the number of TB cases among children and a 16\% decline in the number of TB deaths. In the presence of immigration of tuberculin-positive children, the benefit of targeting programs directly at children is magnified. CONCLUSION(S): Marginal changes in programs targeted directly at children are significantly more effective at further reducing pediatric TB morbidity and mortality than the same changes in programs targeted at adults with the indirect goal of reducing spread to children. Marginal increases in the number of children who enter treatment are far more effective at decreasing morbidity and mortality than equivalent marginal increases in treatment effectiveness. Unfortunately, declining insurance coverage and increasing restrictions on services to immigrants have made it harder for those who are at greatest risk of TB to get medical care. Marginal increases in preventive therapy rates substantially reduce future pediatric TB cases and deaths among children with TB infection and human immunodeficiency virus.},

  abstract = {Despite a long-standing recognition that factors such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status play a fundamental role in tuberculosis transmission and susceptibility, few molecular epidemiological studies have fully elucidated the etiological mechanisms by which each of these social factors may influence transmission of the disease. In this paper, we propose that in order to achieve this goal, molecular epidemiology must move towards a more holistic approach for disease transmission, thus enabling social theory to be integrated into molecular epidemiological studies on tuberculosis. We then present a social network model to illustrate how molecular and social epidemiology can be combined to study disease transmission patterns, and provide preliminary molecular epidemiological evidence to support the role of social networks in tuberculosis transmission. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The mycobacterial cell wall is extraordinarily thick and tight consisting mainly of (1) long chain fatty acids, the mycolic acids, and (2) a unique polysaccharide, arabinogalactan (AG). These two chemical constituents are covalently linked through ester bonds. Minnikin (The Biology of the Mycobacteria; Academic: London, 1982) proposed that the mycobacterial cell wall is composed of an asymmetric lipid bilayer. The inner leaflet of the cell wall contains mycolic acids covalently linked to AG. This inner leaflet is believed to have the lowest permeability to organic compounds of the overall cell wall. Conformational search and molecular dynamics simulation were used to explore the conformational profile of AG and the conformations and structural organization of the mycolic acid-AG complex, and overall, an inner leaflet molecular model of the cell wall was constructed. The terminal arabinose residues of AG that serve as linkers between AG and mycolic acids were found to exist in four major chemical configurations. The mycolate hydrocarbon chains were determined to be tightly packed and perpendicular to the " plane" formed by the oxygen atoms of the 5-hydroxyl groups of the terminal arabinose residues. For Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the average packing distance between mycolic acids is estimated to be approximately 7.3 A. Thus, Minnikin's model is supported by this computational study. Overall, this modeling and simulation approach provides a way to probe the mechanism of low permeability of the cell wall and the intrinsic drug resistance of M. tuberculosis. In addition, monolayer models were built for both dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, two common phospholipids in bacterial and animal membranes, respectively. Structural comparisons of these cell wall phospholipid membrane models were made to the M. tuberculosis cell wall model. \textcopyright{} 2004 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract = {The low permeability of the mycobacterial cell wall is thought to contribute to the intrinsic drug resistance of mycobacteria. In this study, the permeability of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall is studied by computer simulation. Thirteen known drugs with diverse chemical structures were modeled as solutes undergoing transport across a model for the M. tuberculosis cell wall. The properties of the solute-membrane complexes were investigated by means of molecular dynamics simulation, especially the diffusion coefficients of the solute molecules inside the cell wall. The molecular shape of the solute was found to be an important factor for permeation through the M. tuberculosis cell wall. Predominant lateral diffusion within, as opposed to transverse diffusion across, the membrane/cell wall system was observed for some solutes. The extent of lateral diffusion relative to transverse diffusion of a solute within a biological cell membrane may be an important finding with respect to absorption distribution, metabolism, elimination, and toxicity properties of drug candidates. Molecular similarity measures among the solutes were computed, and the results suggest that compounds having high molecular similarity will display similar transport behavior in a common membrane/cell wall environment. In addition, the diffusion coefficients of the solute molecules across the M. tuberculosis cell wall model were compared to those across the monolayers of dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, are two common phospholipids in bacterial and animal membranes. The differences among these three groups of diffusion coefficients were observed and analyzed. \textcopyright{} 2004 American Chemical Society.},

Methods ARIMA model was set up by Eviews 7.0.0.1 and GRNN model was set up by neural network toolbox of Matlab 7.1 based on the monthly tuberculosis incidence data from January 2004 to December 2012 in China. Monthly tuberculosis incidence data in 2013 were subjected to the two models for testing, and the results were compared between the two groups. Results The Theil unequal coefficients (TIC) were 0.034 and 0.059 for ARIMA model and GRNN model, respectively, indicating that ARIMA model was better than GRNN model to fit with the monthly incidence of tuberculosis in 2013. The absolute value of the relative error for ARIMA model was only 57.19\% of GRNN model. Conclusion ARIMA prediction model is more suitable for predicting the incidence of tuberculosis in China, and it is suggested a combination of models should be used to predict the incidence of tuberculosis.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2015, Second Military Medical University Press.

  abstract = {Neutrophil infiltration into tuberculous granulomas is often associated with higher bacteria loads and severe disease but the basis for this relationship is not well understood. To better elucidate the connection between neutrophils and pathology in primate systems, we paired data from experimental studies with our next generation computational model GranSim to identify neutrophil-related factors, including neutrophil recruitment, lifespan, and intracellular bacteria numbers, that drive granuloma-level outcomes. We predict mechanisms underlying spatial organization of neutrophils within granulomas and identify how neutrophils contribute to granuloma dissemination. We also performed virtual deletion and depletion of neutrophils within granulomas and found that neutrophils play a nuanced role in determining granuloma outcome, promoting uncontrolled bacterial growth in some and working to contain bacterial growth in others. Here, we present three key results: We show that neutrophils can facilitate local dissemination of granulomas and thereby enable the spread of infection. We suggest that neutrophils influence CFU burden during both innate and adaptive immune responses, implying that they may be targets for therapeutic interventions during later stages of infection. Further, through the use of uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, we predict which neutrophil processes drive granuloma severity and structure.\textcopyright{} Copyright \textcopyright{} 2021 Hult, Mattila, Gideon, Linderman and Kirschner.},

Addition of preventative therapy for elders would enable China to nearly reach both the incidence and mortality targets, reducing incidence and mortality by 84\% (78-93\%) and 92\% (86-98\%)., CONCLUSIONS: The current decline in incidence is driven by two factors: maintaining a low level of new infections in young individuals and the aging out of older latently infected individuals who contribute incidence due to reactivation disease. While further reducing the level of new infections has a modest effect on burden, interventions that limit reactivation have a greater impact on TB burden. Tools that make preventative therapy more feasible on a large scale and in elders will help China achieve the global targets.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the last 20 years, China ramped up a DOTS (directly observed treatment, short-course)-based tuberculosis (TB) control program with 80\% population coverage, achieving the 2015 Millennium Development Goal of a 50\% reduction in TB prevalence and mortality. Recently, the World Health Organization developed the End TB Strategy, with an overall goal of a 90\% reduction in TB incidence and a 95\% reduction in TB deaths from 2015-2035. As the TB burden shifts to older individuals and China's overall population ages, it is unclear if maintaining the current DOTS strategy will be sufficient for China to reach the global targets., METHODS: We developed an individual-based computational model of TB transmission, implementing realistic age demographics and fitting to country-level data of age-dependent prevalence over time. We explored the trajectory of TB burden if the DOTS strategy is maintained or if new interventions are introduced using currently available and soon-to-be-available tools. These interventions include increasing population coverage of DOTS, reducing time to treatment, increasing treatment success, and active case finding among elders {$>$} 65 years old. We also considered preventative therapy in latently infected elders, a strategy limited by resource constraints and the risk of adverse events., RESULTS: Maintenance of the DOTS strategy reduces TB incidence and mortality by 42\% (95\% credible interval, 27-59\%) and 41\% (5-64\%), respectively, between 2015 and 2035. A combination of all feasible interventions nears the 2035 mortality target, reducing TB incidence and mortality by 59\% (50-76\%) and 83\% (73-94\%).

Data sources: The data used in this review were adopted mainly from the studies of models of tuberculos is reported from 1995 to 2006. Study selection: Relevant literature on transmission models of tuberculosis in heterogeneous populations are referenced. Result(s): Casual/random factors and genetic factors are the main reasons for epidemics of tuberculosis in recent years. Mass public transport is playing the primary role in casually close contact which can facilitate the transmission of tuberculosis. Genetic susceptibility not only varies endemic prevalence levels, but also drastically alters the effects of treatment for tuberculosis patients. Detailed studies further exhibit that casual contact and genetic factor are responsible for over 30\%-40\% of the total new cases in recent years. The prevalence of tuberculosis could double (from 33\% to 60\%) if a genetically susceptible phenotype is present in only 30\% of the population. And some challenges have emerged along with these exciting results. Conclusion(s): Casual/random contact, public transport and genetic susceptibility are responsible for most new tuberculosis cases and a wide variation in endemic tuberculosis levels between regions. Hence, the transmission model of tuberculosis in a heterogeneous population can provide more clues to underlying mechanism of tuberculosis transmission than in a homogeneous population. However, many challenges remain for us in understanding transmission of disease.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological studies typically focus on single-parasite systems, although most hosts harbor multiple parasite species; thus, the potential impacts of co-infection on disease dynamics are only beginning to be recognized. Interactions between macroparasites, such as gastrointestinal nematodes, and microparasites causing diseases like TB, AIDS, and malaria are particularly interesting because co-infection may favor transmission and progression of these important diseases. Here we present evidence for strong interactions between gastrointestinal worms and bovine tuberculosis (TB) in free-ranging African buffalo (Syncerus caffer). TB and worms are negatively associated at the population, among-herd, and within-herd scales, and this association is not solely the result of demographic heterogeneities in infection. Combining data from 1362 buffalo with simple mechanistic models, we find that both accelerated mortality of co-infected individuals and TB transmission heterogeneity caused by trade-offs in immunity to the two types of parasites likely contribute to observed infection patterns. This study is one of the first to examine the relevance of within-host immunological trade-offs for understanding parasite distribution patterns in natural populations.},

Two types of correlations are usually involved: the correlation between the multiple outcomes at one location and the spatial correlation between the locations for one particular outcome. The commonly used regression models only consider one type of correlations while ignoring or modeling inappropriately the other one. To address this limitation, we adopt a Bayesian nonparametric approach to jointly modeling multivariate spatial binary data by integrating both types of correlations. A multivariate probit model is employed to link the binary outcomes to Gaussian latent variables; and Gaussian processes are applied to specify the spatially correlated random effects. We develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for the posterior computation. We illustrate the proposed model on simulation studies and a multidrug-resistant tuberculosis case study.

We provide one of these regression models as a user-friendly, web-based tool. Novel tools can improve our ability to estimate the recent TB transmission proportion from data that are observable (or estimable) by public health practitioners with limited available molecular data.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2015 Kasaie et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.}

  abstract = {Networks and the epidemiology of directly transmitted infectious diseases are fundamentally linked. The foundations of epidemiology and early epidemiological models were based on population wide random-mixing, but in practice each individual has a finite set of contacts to whom they can pass infection; the ensemble of all such contacts forms a `mixing network'. Knowledge of the structure of the network allows models to compute the epidemic dynamics at the population scale from the individual-level behaviour of infections. Therefore, characteristics of mixing networks\textemdash and how these deviate from the random-mixing norm\textemdash have become important applied concerns that may enhance the understanding and prediction of epidemic patterns and intervention measures., Here, we review the basis of epidemiological theory (based on random-mixing models) and network theory (based on work from the social sciences and graph theory). We then describe a variety of methods that allow the mixing network, or an approximation to the network, to be ascertained. It is often the case that time and resources limit our ability to accurately find all connections within a network, and hence a generic understanding of the relationship between network structure and disease dynamics is needed. Therefore, we review some of the variety of idealized network types and approximation techniques that have been utilized to elucidate this link. Finally, we look to the future to suggest how the two fields of network theory and epidemiological modelling can deliver an improved understanding of disease dynamics and better public health through effective disease control.},

  abstract = {Background: The Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) assay offers rapid and accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) but still suffers from imperfect sensitivity. The newer Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra cartridge has shown improved sensitivity in recent field trials, but at the expense of reduced specificity. The clinical implications of switching from the existing Xpert cartridge to the Xpert Ultra cartridge in different populations remain uncertain. Methods and findings: We developed a Markov microsimulation model of hypothetical cohorts of 100,000 individuals undergoing diagnostic sputum evaluation with Xpert for suspected pulmonary TB, in each of 3 emblematic settings: an HIV clinic in South Africa, a public TB center in India, and an adult primary care setting in China. In each setting, we used existing data to project likely diagnostic results, treatment decisions, and ultimate clinical outcomes, assuming use of the standard Xpert versus Xpert Ultra cartridge. Our primary outcomes were the projected number of additional unnecessary treatments generated, the projected number of TB deaths averted, and the projected number of unnecessary treatments generated per TB death averted, if standard Xpert were switched to Xpert Ultra. We also simulated alternative approaches to interpreting positive results of the Ultra cartridge's semi-quantitative trace call. Extensive sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were performed to evaluate the drivers and generalizability of projected results. In the Indian TB center setting, replacing the standard Xpert cartridge with the Xpert Ultra cartridge was projected to avert 0.5 TB deaths (95\% uncertainty range [UR]: 0, 1.3) and generate 18 unnecessary treatments (95\% UR: 10, 29) per 1,000 individuals evaluated-resulting in a median ratio of 38 incremental unnecessary treatments added by Ultra per incremental death averted by Ultra compared to outcomes using standard Xpert (95\% UR: 12, indefinite upper bound). In the South African HIV care setting-where TB mortality rates are higher and Ultra's improved sensitivity has greater absolute benefit-this ratio improved to 7 unnecessary treatments per TB death averted (95\% UR: 2, 43). By contrast, in the Chinese primary care setting, this ratio was much less favorable, at 372 unnecessary treatments per TB death averted (95\% UR: 75, indefinite upper bound), although the projected number of unnecessary treatments using Xpert Ultra was lower (with a possibility of no increased overtreatment) when using specificity data only from lower-burden settings. Alternative interpretations of the trace call had little effect on these ratios. Limitations include uncertainty in key parameters (including the clinical implications of false-negative results), the exclusion of transmission effects, and restriction of this analysis to adult pulmonary TB. Conclusion(s): Switching from the standard Xpert cartridge to the Xpert Ultra cartridge for diagnosis of adult pulmonary TB may have different consequences in different clinical settings. In settings with high TB and HIV prevalence, Xpert Ultra is likely to offer considerable mortality benefit, whereas in lower-prevalence settings, Xpert Ultra will likely result in considerable overtreatment unless the possibility of higher specificity of Ultra in lower-prevalence settings in confirmed. The ideal use of the Ultra cartridge may therefore involve a more nuanced, setting-specific approach to implementation, with priority given to populations in which the anticipated prevalence of TB (and HIV) is the highest.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2017 Kendall et al.},

  abstract = {The expansion of HIV/ADIS epidemic has now become a burning issue globally. HIV infection has changed from a fatal condition to a manageable chronic illness mainly because of the event of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Whether or not ART treatment has shown significant clinical importance by meeting the goal of therapy, but still increases variety of deaths thanks to certain socio-demographic and clinical factors. The aims of this study was to spot determinant factors for the Survival time of adult HIV/ADIS Infected Patients under the follow-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) at Debere Berhan clinic and model the progression of HIV/AIDS disease of a personal patient under ART follow-up supported CD4 level using Markov process processes. A retrospective study was undertaken on a sample of 301 HIV/AIDS patients were selected supported simple sampling technique for this study. Within the followed up period, 43 (14.3\%) patients died and 258 (85.7\%) patients were censored. From the whole death the bulk of death 13(4.3\%) and 10(3.3\%) deaths occurred within six months and twelve months of ART initiation, respectively. The Cox PH regression result indicated that the survival time of the HIV patient was significantly related with legal status, TB history, employment status, OIs, WHO stage, Regimen type, and Hemoglobin level. To determine Progression of HIV/AIDS Disease States, States of the stochastic process are defined by the seriousness of the sickness supported the CD4 counts. The states will be state I: CD4 count {$>$} 500 cells/muL, state II: 350 {$<$} CD4 count {$<$}= 500 cells/ muL, state III: 200 {$<$} CD4 count {$<$}= 350 cells/ muL, state IV: CD4 count {$<$}= 200 cell/ muL and Death. The primary four states are named pretty much as good states and Death were bad or absorbing state. There have been transitions between good states to the following worse state. From the above four state, in state IV there have been high number of deaths compared to others state. This means that the probability of dying increase with decreasing CD4 counts over time.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020 Ubiquity Press. All rights reserved.},

Our study prioritized M. tuberculosis therapeutic targets (aspartate-beta-semialdeyhde dehydrogenase [ASD], dihydrodipicolinate reductase and diaminopimelate decarboxylase) based on flux and elementary mode analysis using direct mathematical modeling of the relevant metabolic pathways. Molecular docking and simulation studies of the priority target (ie, ASD) revealed the therapeutic potential of the selected natural products (Huperzine A, Rosmarinic acid, and Curcumin) based ASD inhibitors. The study highlights the crucial role of systems biology in conjunction with molecular interaction (docking) for probing novel leads against an increasingly resistant pathogen, M. tuberculousis.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {It has long been a quest in ruminants to understand how two very similar mycobacterial species, Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) and Mycobacterium avium ssp. Avium (MAA) lead to either a chronic persistent infection or a rapid-transient infection, respectively. Here, we hypothesized that when the host immune response is activated by MAP or MAA, the outcome of the infection depends on the early activation of signaling molecules and host temporal gene expression. To test our hypothesis, ligated jejuno-ileal loops including Peyer's patches in neonatal calves were inoculated with PBS, MAP, or MAA. A temporal analysis of the host transcriptome profile was conducted at several times postinfection (0.5,1,2,4,8 and 12 hours). When comparing the transcriptional responses of calves infected with the MAA versus MAP, discordant patterns of mucosal expression were clearly evident, and the numbers of unique transcripts altered were moderately less for MAA-infected tissue than were mucosal tissues infected with the MAP. To interpret these complex data, changes in the gene expression were further analyzed by dynamic Bayesian analysis. Bayesian network modeling identified mechanistic genes, gene-to-gene relationships, pathways and Gene Ontologies (GO) biological processes that are involved in specific cell activation during infection. MAP and MAA had significant different pathway perturbation at 0.5 and 12 hours post inoculation. Inverse processes were observed between MAP and MAA response for epithelial cell proliferation, negative regulation of chemotaxis, cell-cell adhesion mediated by integrin and regulation of cytokine-mediated signaling. MAP inoculated tissue had significantly lower expression of phagocytosis receptors such as mannose receptor and complement receptors. This study reveals that perturbation of genes and cellular pathways during MAP infection resulted in host evasion by mucosal membrane barrier weakening to access entry in the ileum, inhibition of Ca signaling associated with decreased phagosome-lysosome fusion as well as phagocytosis inhibition, bias toward Th2 cell immune response accompanied by cell recruitment, cell proliferation and cell differentiation; leading to persistent infection. Contrarily, MAA infection was related to cellular responses associated with activation of molecular pathways that release chemicals and cytokines involved with containment of infection and a strong bias toward Th1 immune response, resulting in a transient infection.Copyright \textcopyright{} This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

Using a discrete stochastic transmission model, we estimated that multilevel policies, including extensive testing, contact tracing, and quarantine, reduced contact rates by 90\% and rapidly decreased the epidemic in Daegu and nationwide during February-March 2020. Absence of these prompt responses could have resulted in a {$>$}10-fold increase in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths by May 15, 2020, relative to the status quo. The model suggests that reallocation of persons who have mild or asymptomatic cases to community treatment centers helped avoid overwhelming hospital capacity and enabled healthcare workers to provide care for more severely and critically ill patients in hospital beds and negative-pressure intensive care units. As small outbreaks continue to occur, contact tracing and maintenance of hospital capacity are needed.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Mathematical and computational modeling can be used to integrate various types of experimental data and suggest new hypotheses, mechanisms, and therapeutic approaches to TB. Here, we offer a first-time comprehensive review of work on within-host TB models that describe the immune response to infection, including the formation of lung granulomas. The models include systems of ordinary and partial differential equations and agent-based models as well as hybrid and multi-scale models that are combinations of these. Many aspects of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, including host dynamics in the lung (typical site of infection for TB), granuloma formation, roles of cytokine and chemokine dynamics, and bacterial nutrient availability have been explored. Finally, we survey applications of these within-host models to TB therapy and prevention and suggest future directions to impact this global disease.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2017 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Background: Migrant populations such as mine workers contributed to the spread of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. We used a mathematical model to estimate the community-wide impact of targeting treatment and prevention to male migrants. Method(s): We augmented an individual-based network model, EMOD-HIV v0.8, to include an age-dependent propensity for males to migrate. Migrants were exposed to HIV outside their home community, but continued to participate in HIV transmission in the community during periodic visits. Result(s): Migrant-targeted interventions would have been transformative in the 1980s to 1990s, but post-2015 impacts were more modest. When targetable migrants comprised 2\% of adult males, workplace HIV prevention averted 3.5\% of community-wide infections over 20 years. Targeted treatment averted 8.5\% of all-cause deaths among migrants. When migrants comprised 10\% of males, workplace prevention averted 16.2\% of infections in the community, one-quarter of which were among migrants. Workplace prevention and treatment acted synergistically, averting 17.1\% of community infections and 11.6\% of deaths among migrants. These estimates do not include prevention of secondary spread of HIV or tuberculosis at the workplace. Conclusion(s): Though cost-effective, targeting migrants cannot collapse generalized epidemics in their home communities. Such a strategy would only have been possible prior to the early 1990s. However, migrant-targeted interventions synergize with general-population expansion of HIV services.Copyright \textcopyright{} The Author 2015.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A 4-month first-line treatment regimen for tuberculosis disease (TB) is expected to have a direct impact on patient outcomes and societal costs, as well as an indirect impact on Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission. We aimed to estimate this combined impact in a high TB-burden country: South Africa. METHOD: An individual based M. tb transmission model was fitted to the TB burden of South Africa using a standard TB natural history framework. We measured the impact on TB burden from 2015-2035 of introduction of a non-inferior 4-month regimen replacing the standard 6-month regimen as first-line therapy. Impact was measured with respect to three separate baselines (Guidelines, Policy and Current), reflecting differences in adherence to TB and HIV treatment guidelines. Further scenario analyses considered the variation in treatment-related parameters and resistance levels. Impact was measured in terms of differences in TB burden and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) averted. We also examined the highest cost at which the new regimen would be cost-effective for several willingness-to-pay thresholds. RESULTS: It was estimated that a 4-month regimen would avert less than 1\% of the predicted 6 million person years with TB disease in South Africa between 2015 and 2035. A similarly small impact was seen on deaths and DALYs averted. Despite this small impact, with the health systems and patient cost savings from regimen shortening, the 4-month regimen could be cost-effective at \$436 [NA, 5983] (mean [range]) per month at a willingness-to-pay threshold of one GDP per capita (\$6,618). CONCLUSION: The introduction of a non-inferior 4-month first-line TB regimen into South Africa would have little impact on the TB burden. However, under several scenarios, it is likely that the averted societal costs would make such a regimen cost-effective in South Africa.},

Estimates for the relative fitness of resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains are highly heterogeneous and mostly derived from in vitro experiments. Measuring fitness in the field allows us to determine how the environment influences the spread of resistance. We designed a household structured, stochastic mathematical model to estimate the fitness costs associated with multidrug resistance (MDR) carriage in Mtb in Lima, Peru during 2010 - 2013. By fitting the model to data from a large prospective cohort study of TB disease in household contacts, we estimated the fitness, relative to susceptible strains with a fitness of 1, of MDR-Mtb to be 0.32 (95\% credible interval: 0.15 - 0.62) or 0.38 (0.24 - 0.61), if only transmission or progression to disease, respectively, was affected. The relative fitness of MDR-Mtb increased to 0.56 (0.42 - 0.72) when the fitness cost influenced both transmission and progression to disease equally. We found the average relative fitness of MDR-Mtb circulating within households in Lima, Peru during 2010 - 2013 to be significantly lower than concurrent susceptible Mtb. If these fitness levels do not change, then existing TB control programmes are likely to keep MDR-TB prevalence at current levels in Lima, Peru.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2018 The Authors.},

This study presents a simulation model for a hypothetical hospital waiting room, in which the number of susceptible immunocompetent people in the waiting room follows a Poisson distribution (M = 5) in either low (annual number of TB patients = 5) or high TB risk settings (annual number of TB patients = 50), and used the model to evaluate the reduction of TB transmission risk by upper room UVGI. An exponential dose-response model was used for TB transmission and a two-zone model was used for evaluating the effect of upper room UVGI. Upper room UVGI reduced TB risk by 1.6-fold at 3 muW/cm2 UV irradiance in the upper room in the low TB risk setting and by 4.1-fold at 15 muW/cm2 UV irradiance in the upper room in the high TB risk setting. Use of upper room UVGI also reduced the mean annual new infection rate from 2.2 to 1.3 infections per year at 3 muW/cm2 and to 0.6 infections per year at 15 muW/cm2 in our hypothetical high-risk settings. The effect of upper room UVGI was sensitive to both vertical air velocity (air mixing) and UV irradiance level. Results from partitioning variability indicate that most variability of TB transmission risk came from waiting time in our hypothetical hospital.},

  abstract = {Background: In conjunction with the spread of HIV infection, tuberculosis (TB) remains a major cause of illness and death worldwide. The Ethiopian national report reveals that extra pulmonary tuberculosis is on the rise and that case detection rate is exceeding that of smear positive or negative cases in many parts of the country. Different studies indicated that host and/or pathogen related factors are associated with the rise of extra pulmonary cases. However, the reason for this is not clearly known in our setting. Method(s): Specimens were taken from clinically suspected extra pulmonary patients and confirmed by cytology, histopathology and culture. Deletion typing and Spoligotyping was utilized to identify the strains. The isolates were then assigned to lineage using conformal Bayesian network (rules model) algorithm and dendrograms were drawn using UPGMA methods. In addition, drug sensitivity test was done using the indirect proportion and 24 well plate methods. Result(s): Out of the 200 clinically suspected extra pulmonary tuberculosis patients, 106 (53 \%) were between 15 and 35 years of age and 167 (83.5 \%) were new while 33 (16.5 \%) were retreatment cases. The culture yield was 29.5 \% (59). Of these only one was M. bovis and 58 were M. tuberculosis strains with 31 different spoligotype patterns grouped into seven clusters. The largest cluster (ST53) comprised 12 (20.3 \%) isolates. There was higher clustering of CAS isolates in TBLN than in any other form of extra pulmonary tuberculosis cases. Resistance to rifampicin was higher (22 \%) than that for INH, STM and EMB (8.1 \%, 5 \% and 3 \% respectively). Out of the 37 isolates tested for resistance, only 2 isolates were resistant for both STM and INH and no MDR strain was found. Conclusion(s): There is an ongoing active recent transmission among extra pulmonary tuberculosis in the study areas as shown by the presence of clusters. Although no MDR case was observed, there is a risk of emergence of MDR as noted from the high proportion of resistance to rifampicin. Detailed study at population level is recommended to monitor its trend.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2015 Korma et al.},

  abstract = {There is now a large literature on the analysis of diagnostic test data. In the absence of a gold standard test, latent class analysis is most often used to estimate the prevalence of the condition of interest and the properties of the diagnostic tests. When test results are measured on a continuous scale, both parametric and nonparametric models have been proposed. Parametric methods such as the commonly used bi-normal model may not fit the data well; nonparametric methods developed to date have been relatively complex to apply in practice, and their properties have not been carefully evaluated in the diagnostic testing context. In this paper, we propose a simple yet flexible Bayesian nonparametric model which approximates a Dirichlet process for continuous data. We compare results from the nonparametric model with those from the bi-normal model via simulations, investigating both how much is lost in using a nonparametric model when the bi-normal model is correct and how much can be gained in using a nonparametric model when normality does not hold. We also carefully investigate the trade-offs that occur between flexibility and identifiability of the model as different Dirichlet process prior distributions are used. Motivated by an application to tuberculosis clustering, we extend our nonparametric model to accommodate two additional dichotomous tests and proceed to analyze these data using both the continuous test alone as well as all three tests together. \textcopyright{} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The introduction and scale-up of new tools for the diagnosis of Tuberculosis (TB) in developing countries has the potential to make a huge difference to the lives of millions of people living in poverty. To achieve this, policy makers need the information to make the right decisions about which new tools to implement and where in the diagnostic algorithm to apply them most effectively. These decisions are difficult as the new tools are often expensive to implement and use, and the health system and patient impacts uncertain, particularly in developing countries where there is a high burden of TB. The authors demonstrate that a discrete event simulation model could play a significant part in improving and informing these decisions. The feasibility of linking the discrete event simulation to a dynamic epidemiology model is also explored in order to take account of longer term impacts on the incidence of TB. Results from two diagnostic districts in Tanzania are used to illustrate how the approach could be used to improve decisions. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Background The explosive increase in the number of people infected with tuberculosis, multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB), and injecting drug users (IDU) HIV/AIDS has become a serious public health challenge in Russia. The World Health Organization (WHO) is recommending policies including simultaneous use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to treat HIV/AIDS and second line drugs to treat MDRTB. However, it is not clear what would be the impact of implementing these recommendations on tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS mortality. In this context, the aim of this research is to quantify the consequences of adopting these policies in terms of deaths reduction. Methods A System Dynamics (SD) computer simulation model was developed to represent the dynamic transmission of tuberculosis, MDRTB, and HIV/AIDS. The model represented explicitly the complex interactions between these diseases and how these link to their transmission and spread in the population. The model simulated scenarios, over a 20 years period, regarding MDRTB cure rate and the fraction of HIV/AIDS patients covered by HAART. Results The results over a 20 year period indicate that reduction in tuberculosis and HIV associated tuberculosis deaths would be negligible for HAART coverage up to 50\%. The reduction is only significant for HAART coverage of 70\% and above. Similarly, high MDRTB cure rate reduces significantly deaths from tuberculosis and MDRTB and this reduction is more important as the HAART coverage is increased. Discussion This research demonstrates, through a computer simulation model, that policies recommended by the WHO will not be effective unless HAART coverage is ramped up to include a sizeable fraction of HIV/AIDS patients. This will have to be coupled with an extensive use of second line drugs to address MDRTB. It is only through combination of these policies that tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS mortality could be reduced significantly.},

  abstract = {Background While our previous work has shown that replacing existing vaccines with thermostable vaccines can relieve bottlenecks in vaccine supply chains and thus increase vaccine availability, the question remains whether this benefit would outweigh the additional cost of thermostable formulations. Methods Using HERMES simulation models of the vaccine supply chains for the Republic of Benin, the state of Bihar (India), and Niger, we simulated replacing different existing vaccines with thermostable formulations and determined the resulting clinical and economic impact. Costs measured included the costs of vaccines, logistics, and disease outcomes averted. Results Replacing a particular vaccine with a thermostable version yielded cost savings in many cases even when charging a price premium (two or three times the current vaccine price). For example, replacing the current pentavalent vaccine with a thermostable version without increasing the vaccine price saved from \$366 to \$10,945 per 100 members of the vaccine's target population. Doubling the vaccine price still resulted in cost savings that ranged from \$300 to \$10,706, and tripling the vaccine price resulted in cost savings from \$234 to \$10,468. As another example, a thermostable rotavirus vaccine (RV) at its current (year) price saved between \$131 and \$1065. Doubling and tripling the thermostable rotavirus price resulted in cost savings ranging from \$102 to \$936 and \$73 to \$808, respectively. Switching to thermostable formulations was highly cost-effective or cost-effective in most scenarios explored. Conclusion Medical cost and productivity savings could outweigh even significant price premiums charged for thermostable formulations of vaccines, providing support for their use.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2017 The Authors},

Data analysis was based upon regional ratios or penetration indices. To improve the analytical usefulness and objectivity, labeled drug from dynamic PET images was mapped into 23 airway generations following a general framework from a SPECT-based methodology (Fleming, J.S., Nassim, M.A., Hashish, A.H., Bailey, A.G., Conway, J., Holgate, S., Halson, P., Moore, E., Martonen, T.B., 1995. Description of pulmonary deposition of radiolabeled aerosol by airway generation using a conceptual three dimensional model of lung morphology. J. Aerosol Med. 8, 341-356). A recently developed airway network model was used in this study. Quantitative PET scans of [C-11]triamcinolone acetonide distribution in the lung were determined following administration of Azmacort, a commercial metered dose inhaler with an integrated spacer device. Distributions at varying time periods after drug administration were investigated to explore the dynamics and kinetics of the aerosolized drug. Initially, deposition of labeled drug on conducting airways (generations 1-14) was found to be higher than those on acinar airways (generation 15-23), 64\% versus 36\%. The distribution pattern changed slowly with time. By 47 min, 51\% of the dose remaining in the lung was found on conducting airways while 49\% was on acinar airways. This study illustrates the value of PET imaging for the evaluation and design of drug formulations. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Truenat is a new, battery-powered RT-PCR device that rapidly detects TB and rifampin resistance. Due to its portability, it may be valuable in peripheral healthcare settings. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of Truenat in peripheral laboratories (designated microscopy centres [DMCs]) and public healthcare facilities in India. Methods. We used the CEPAC-International microsimulation model to compare four TB diagnostic strategies for adult, HIV-negative patients with suspected TB: (1) sputum smear microscopy in DMCs (SSM); (2) Xpert MTB/RIF in DMCs (Xpert); (3) Truenat in DMCs (Truenat DMC); and (4) Truenat in public healthcare facilities (Truenat POC). We projected life expectancy (LE), costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and 5y budget impact of full scale-up. A strategy was cost-effective if its ICER was 86\%, was cost-effective and sometimes cost-saving compared with Xpert (Figure 1). The cost-effectiveness of Truenat, relative to Xpert, depended on the interplay of sensitivity and linkage to care. Public-sector implementation of Truenat POC increased healthcare expenditures by \$360 million compared with full scale-up of Xpert (Figure 2). Treatment costs, not diagnostic test costs, accounted for most of the diference. Conclusion. When used at the point of care, Truenat for TB diagnosis should improve linkage to care, increase LE, and be cost-effective compared with SSM or Xpert and, thus, should be more widely utilized in India.},

  abstract = {Bacterial populations produce a small number of dormant persister cells that exhibit multidrug tolerance. All resistance mechanisms do essentially the same thing: prevent the antibiotic from hitting a target. By contrast, tolerance apparently works by shutting down the targets. Bactericidal antibiotics kill bacteria by corrupting their targets, rather than merely inhibiting them. Shutting down the targets then protects from killing. The number of persisters in a growing population of bacteria rises at mid-log and reaches a maximum of approximately 1\% at stationary state. Similarly, slow-growing biofilms produce substantial numbers of persisters. The ability of a biofilm to limit the access of the immune system components, and the ability of persisters to sustain an antibiotic attack could then account for the recalcitrance of such infections in vivo and for their relapsing nature. Isolation of Escherichia coli persisters by lysing a population or by sorting GFP-expressing cells with diminished translation allowed to obtain a gene expression profile. The profile indicated downregulated biosynthetic pathways, consistent with their dormant nature, and indicated overexpression of toxin/antitoxin (TA) modules. Stochastic overexpression of toxins that inhibit essential functions such as translation may contribute to persister formation. Ectopic expression of RelE, MazF, and HipA toxins produced multidrug tolerant cells. Apart from TA modules, glpD and plsB were identified as potential persister genes by overexpression cloning of a genomic library and selection for antibiotic tolerance. Yeast Candida albicans forms recalcitrant biofilm infections that are tolerant to antibiotics, similarly to bacterial biofilms. C. albicans biofilms produce multidrug tolerant persisters that are not mutants, but rather phenotypic variants of the wild type. Unlike bacterial persisters, however, C. albicans persisters were only observed in a biofilm, but not in a planktonic stationary population. Identification of persister genes opens the way to a rational design of anti-biofilm therapy. Combination of a conventional antibiotic with a compound inhibiting persister formation or maintenance may produce an effective therapeutic. Other approaches to the problem include sterile-surface materials, prodrug antibiotics, and cyclical application of conventional antimicrobials. \textcopyright{} 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine tuberculosis (TB) population dynamics and to assess potential infection risk in Taiwan. A well-established mathematical model of TB transmission built on previous models was adopted to study the potential impact of TB transmission. A probabilistic risk model was also developed to estimate site-specific risks of developing disease soon after recent primary infection, exogenous reinfection, or through endogenous reactivation (latently infected TB) among Taiwan regions. Here, we showed that the proportion of endogenous reactivation (53-67\%) was larger than that of exogenous reinfection (32-47\%). Our simulations showed that as epidemic reaches a steady state, age distribution of cases would finally shift toward older age groups dominated by latently infected TB cases as a result of endogenous reactivation. A comparison of age-weighted TB incidence data with our model simulation output with 95\% credible intervals revealed that the predictions were in an apparent agreement with observed data. The median value of overall basic reproduction number (R0) in eastern Taiwan ranged from 1.65 to 1.72, whereas northern Taiwan had the lowest R0 estimate of 1.50. We found that total TB incidences in eastern Taiwan had 25-27\% probabilities of total proportion of infected population exceeding 90\%, whereas there were 36-66\% probabilities having exceeded 20\% of total proportion of infected population attributed to latently infected TB. We suggested that our Taiwan-based analysis can be extended to the context of developing countries, where TB remains a substantial cause of elderly morbidity and mortality. \textcopyright{} 2012 Society for Risk Analysis.},

  abstract = {Species of the genus Mycobacterium differ in several features, from geographic ranges, and degree of pathogenicity, to ecological and host preferences. The recent availability of several fully sequenced genomes for a number of these species enabled the comparative study of the genetic determinants of this wide lifestyle diversity. Here, we applied two complementary phylogenetic-based approaches using information from 19 Mycobacterium genomes to obtain a more comprehensive view of the evolution of this genus. First, we inferred the phylogenetic relationships using two new approaches, one based on a Mycobacterium-specific amino acid substitution matrix and the other on a gene content dissimilarity matrix. Then, we utilized our recently developed gain-and-death stochastic models to study gene turnover dynamics in this genus in a maximum-likelihood framework. We uncovered a scenario that differs markedly from traditional 16S rRNA data and improves upon recent phylogenomic approaches. We also found that the rates of gene gain and death are high and unevenly distributed both across species and across gene families, further supporting the utility of the new models of rate heterogeneity applied in a phylogenetic context. Finally, the functional annotation of the most expanded or contracted gene families revealed that the transposable elements and the fatty acid metabolism-related gene families are the most important drivers of gene content evolution in Mycobacterium.

  abstract = {Background: Many studies have compared the performance of time series models in predicting pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), but few have considered the role of meteorological factors in their prediction models. This study aims to explore whether incorporating meteorological factors can improve the performance of time series models in predicting PTB. Method(s): We collected the monthly reported number of PTB cases and records of six meteorological factors in three cities of China from 2005 to 2018. Based on this data, we constructed three time series models, including an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, the ARIMA with exogenous variables (ARIMAX) model, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) model. The ARIMAX and RNN models incorporated meteorological factors, while the ARIMA model did not. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) were used to evaluate the performance of the models in predicting PTB cases in 2018. Result(s): Both the cross-correlation analysis and Spearman rank correlation test showed that PTB cases reported in the study areas were related to meteorological factors. The predictive performance of both the ARIMA and RNN models was improved after incorporating meteorological factors. The MAPEs of the ARIMA, ARIMAX, and RNN models were 12.54\%, 11.96\%, and 12.36\% in Xuzhou, 15.57\%, 11.16\%, and 14.09\% in Nantong, and 9.70\%, 9.66\%, and 12.50\% in Wuxi, respectively. The RMSEs of the three models were 36.194, 33.956, and 34.785 in Xuzhou, 34.073, 25.884, and 31.828 in Nantong, and 19.545, 19.026, and 26.019 in Wuxi, respectively. Conclusion(s): Our study revealed a possible link between PTB and meteorological factors. Taking meteorological factors into consideration increased the accuracy of time series models in predicting PTB, and the ARIMAX model was superior to the ARIMA and RNN models in study settings.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020, The Author(s).},

In this study, we performed validation research by comparing the accuracy of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model in a southeastern province of China. Method(s): We applied the data from 462,214 notified pulmonary tuberculosis cases registered from January 2005 to December 2015 in Jiangsu Province to modulate and construct the ARIMA and BPNN models. Cases registered in 2016 were used to assess the prediction accuracy of the models. The root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean error rate (MER) were used to evaluate the model fitting and forecasting effect. Result(s): During 2005-2015, the annual pulmonary tuberculosis notification rate in Jiangsu Province was 56.35/100,000, ranging from 40.85/100,000 to 79.36/100,000. Through screening and comparison, the ARIMA (0, 1, 2) (0, 1, 1)12 and BPNN (3-9-1) were defined as the optimal fitting models. In the fitting dataset, the RMSE, MAPE, MAE and MER were 0.3901, 6.0498, 0.2740 and 0.0608, respectively, for the ARIMA (0, 1, 2) (0, 1, 1)12 model, 0.3236, 6.0113, 0.2508 and 0.0587, respectively, for the BPNN model. In the forecasting dataset, the RMSE, MAPE, MAE and MER were 0.1758, 4.6041, 0.1368 and 0.0444, respectively, for the ARIMA (0, 1, 2) (0, 1, 1)12 model, and 0.1382, 3.2172, 0.1018 and 0.0330, respectively, for the BPNN model. Conclusion(s): Both the ARIMA and BPNN models can be used to predict the seasonality and trend of pulmonary tuberculosis in the Chinese population, but the BPNN model shows better performance. Applying statistical techniques by considering local characteristics may enable more accurate mathematical modeling.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2019 Liu et al.},

  abstract = {Background: An epidemic can spread rapidly among a large number of people in a community within a short period of time. Some infectious diseases, including influenza, hand, foot and mouth disease, dengue and meningitis, are temporally limited by variations in the meteorological factors, such as sunshine, temperature, humidity, rainfall, atmospheric pressure, wind speed and so on. Therefore, it is necessary to predict the behavior of outbreak of these infectious diseases based on meteorological factors. Objective(s): Review various epidemic models related to meteorological factors. Result(s): We discuss two kinds of epidemic models: deterministic models and stochastic models. The deterministic models include switched SIR model, seasonal SIR model, periodic SEIR system and seasonal SEIQR model. And the stochastic models involve multiple regression models, auto-regressive moving average model, autoregressive distributed lag model, time series Poisson regression models and generalized additive models. Furthermore, we introduce the latest applications of these models, respectively. Conclusion(s): In our work, these deterministic models and stochastic models can successfully predict the diseases outbreak using meteorological factors, and they all are now widely used in the field. However, few meteorological factors are used in these models. With the development of Meteorological Science, large amounts of Meteorological factor data will be obtained. More key Meteorological factors causing an epidemic will be identified. Therefore, in the future, more key meteorological factors will be considered in models and they will further improve the accuracy of the forecast.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.},

Our modelling indicates that downstream genes embedded within LRCs are highly insulated from the variation in expression of upstream genes, and thus LRCs act as attenuators. This observation implies a progressively weaker functionality of LRCs as their length increases. When analyzing the preponderance of LRCs in the GRNs of Escherichia coli K12 and several other organisms, we find that very long LRCs are essentially absent. In both E. coli and M. tuberculosis we find that four-gene LRCs are intimately linked to identical feedback loops that are involved in potentially chaotic stress response, indicating that the dynamics of these potentially destabilising motifs are strongly restrained under homeostatic conditions. The same relationship is observed in a human cancer cell line (K562), and we postulate that four-gene LRCs act as 'universal attenuators'. These findings suggest a role for long LRCs in dampening variation in gene expression, thereby protecting cell identity, and in controlling dramatic shifts in cell-wide gene expression through inhibiting chaos-generating motifs.Copyright \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2017.},

To evaluate a range of respiratory drug delivery conditions, a model dry powder inhaler (DPI; NovolizerTM) and a model spray soft-mist inhaler (SMI; RespimatTM) were considered. The respiratory geometry consisted of a previously developed characteristic MT and complete upper TB geometry through the third bifurcation (B3). More distal TB airways were simulated using stochastic individual path (SIP) models extending into each of the five lung lobes through bifurcation B15. Based on comparisons with new in vitro deposition data, results indicated that the low Reynolds number (LRN) k-turbulence model with near-wall corrections for anisotropic turbulence and velocity conditions accurately predicted deposited drug mass from both inhalers. Simulating the polydisperse aerosol size distribution had a large impact on overall deposited drug mass compared with a monodisperse approximation. However, a new equivalent mass median diameter (MMD), calculated as MMDeq = 1.25 MMD, was shown to provide a good monodisperse estimate of the aerosol deposition from both inhalers considered in this study used with different inhalation flow conditions in the SIP models. Large variations in deposition were observed among the five lung lobes. However, deposition in the left lower lobe (scaled by a factor of 5) was found to be characteristic of total lobar deposition in the range of B4-B15 and allowed for the simulation of only one lobe. Implementing the approximations of an equivalent MMD and simulating deposition in one characteristic lung lobe increased the efficiency of the airway CFD simulations by over 25times at the expense of a maximum 12\% relative error compared with the more exact simulations. As an example of model utility, results indicated that the state-of-the-art SMI improved delivery efficiency of drug by a factor of 1.5 in the upper TB region and by over an order of magnitude in the lower TB airways compared with a commonly used high quality DPI.

  abstract = {The emergence of antibiotic resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis has raised the concern that pathogen strains that are virtually untreatable may become widespread. The acquisition of resistance to antibiotics results in a longer duration of infection in a host, but this resistance may come at a cost through a decreased transmission rate. This raises the question of whether the overall fitness of drugresistant strains is higher than that of sensitive strains-essential information for predicting the spread of the disease. Here,wedirectly estimate the transmission cost of drug resistance, the rate at which resistance evolves, and the relative fitness of resistant strains. These estimates are made by using explicit models of the transmission and evolution of sensitive and resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, using approximate Bayesian computation, and molecular epidemiology data from Cuba, Estonia, and Venezuela. We find that the transmission cost of drug resistance relative to sensitivity can be as low as 10\%, that resistance evolves at rates of -0.0025-0.02 per case per year, and that the overall fitness of resistant strains is comparable with that of sensitive strains. Furthermore, the contribution of transmission to the spread of drug resistance is very high compared with acquired resistance due to treatment failure (up to 99\%). Estimating such parameters directly from in vivo data will be critical to understanding and responding to antibiotic resistance. For instance, projections using our estimates suggest that the prevalence of tuberculosis may decline with successful treatment, but the proportion of cases associated with resistance is likely to increase.},

The stochastic nature of this disease infection could be linked to the stochastic behaviour at genome level which is exhibited in SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) distributions of experimentally identified hotspot driver genes. Our results show the emergence of random clusters, and well-defined discrete domains of the respective species populations in the model driven by demographic stochasticity and intrinsic complex species interaction. The multifractal analysis of the time series of the species populations indicate that TB epidemic could be mainly caused by contact communication and is directional. We propose that any TB epidemic may have high chance of approximately periodic recurrence and can be controlled by optimizing some of the parameters involved in the system modelling.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Tuberculosis is a worldwide health problem with 2 billion people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb, the bacteria causing TB). The hallmark of infection is the emergence of organized structures of immune cells forming primarily in the lung in response to infection. Granulomas physically contain and immunologically restrain bacteria that cannot be cleared. We have developed several models that spatially characterize the dynamics of the host-mycobacterial interaction, and identified mechanisms that control granuloma formation and development. In particular, we published several agent-based models (ABMs) of granuloma formation in TB that include many subtypes of T cell populations, macrophages as well as key cytokine and chemokine effector molecules. These ABM studies emphasize the important role of T-cell related mechanisms in infection progression, such as magnitude and timing of T cell recruitment, and macrophage activation. In these models, the priming and recruitment of T cells from the lung draining lymph node (LN) was captured phenomenologically. In addition to these ABM studies, we have also developed several multi-organ models using ODEs to examine trafficking of cells between, for example, the lung and LN. While we can predict temporal dynamic behaviors, those models are not coupled to the spatial aspects of granuloma. To this end, we have developed a multi-organ model that is hybrid: an ABM for the lung compartment and a non-linear system of ODE representing the lymph node compartment. This hybrid multi-organ approach to study TB granuloma formation in the lung and immune priming in the LN allows us to dissect protective mechanisms that cannot be achieved using the single compartment or multi-compartment ODE system. The main finding of this work is that trafficking of important cells known as antigen presenting cells from the lung to the lymph node is a key control mechanism for protective immunity: the entire spectrum of infection outcomes can be regulated by key immune cell migration rates. Our hybrid multi-organ implementation suggests that effector CD4+ T cells can rescue the system from a persistent infection and lead to clearance once a granuloma is fully formed. This could be effective as an immunotherapy strategy for latently infected individuals. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Method(s): The proposed stochastic model is based on a Gibbs sampling algorithm that uses information of lost to follow-up at the end of a longitudinal study. For simulating the unknown number of reactors at the end of the study and lost to follow-up, but not reactors at time 0, a latent variable was introduced in the new model. An exercise of application of both models in the comparison of the estimates of interest was presented. Result(s): The point estimates obtained from both models are near identical; however, the Bayesian model allowed the estimation of credible intervals as measures of precision of the estimated parameters. Conclusion(s): The Bayesian model can be valuable in longitudinal studies with low adherence to follow-up.},

We systematically searched for and included studies in which latent tuberculosis infection was assessed in 2 groups: children exposed and unexposed to a household member with tuberculosis. We also extracted data on the smear and culture status of index cases, the age and bacillus Calmette-Gu\'erin vaccination status of contacts, and study design characteristics. Of 6,176 citations identified from our search strategy, 26 studies (13,999 children with household exposure to tuberculosis and 174,097 children without) from 1929\textendash 2015 met inclusion criteria. Exposed children were 3.79 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 3.01, 4.78) times more likely to be infected than were their community counterparts. Metaregression demonstrated higher infection among children aged 0\textendash 4 years of age compared with children aged 10\textendash 14 years (ratio of odds ratios~=~2.24, 95\% CI: 1.43, 3.51) and among smear-positive versus smear-negative index cases (ratio of odds ratios~=~5.45, 95\% CI: 3.43, 8.64). At the population level, we estimated that a small proportion (\&lt;20\%) of transmission was attributable to household exposure. Our results suggest that targeting tuberculosis prevention efforts to household contacts is highly effective. However, a large proportion of transmission at the population level may occur outside the household.},

Dry particles are mixed with water vapour-laden air at the entrance to a growth chamber temperature controlled at 37degreeC with a relative humidity (RH) between 88 and 95\%. Hygroscopic growth rates increased with degree of RH and magnitude of Reynolds number in the chamber. The growth data are incorporated into an aerosol deposition model to calculate the effect of hygroscopic growth upon the dose distribution of medicinal aerosols in the human TB network. The model uses some original deposition formulae to compute particle deposition efficiencies. Calculations show that the rate of water vapour absorption within TB airways is an important factor affecting the fate of particles used in aerosol therapy.},

WHO guidelines on tuberculosis (TB) infection prevention and control (IPC) recommend a range of measures to reduce transmission in healthcare settings. These were evaluated primarily based on evidence for their effects on transmission to healthcare workers in hospitals. To estimate the overall impact of IPC interventions, it is necessary to also consider their impact on community-wide TB incidence and mortality. METHODS: We developed an individual-based model of Mtb transmission in households, primary healthcare (PHC) clinics, and all other congregate settings. The model was parameterised using data from a high HIV prevalence community in South Africa, including data on social contact by setting, by sex, age, and HIV/antiretroviral therapy status; and data on TB prevalence in clinic attendees and the general population. We estimated the proportion of disease in adults that resulted from transmission in PHC clinics, and the impact of a range of IPC interventions in clinics on community-wide TB. RESULTS: We estimate that 7.6\% (plausible range 3.9\%-13.9\%) of non-multidrug resistant and multidrug resistant TB in adults resulted directly from transmission in PHC clinics in the community in 2019. The proportion is higher in HIV-positive people, at 9.3\% (4.8\%-16.8\%), compared with 5.3\% (2.7\%-10.1\%) in HIV-negative people. We estimate that IPC interventions could reduce incident TB cases in the community in 2021-2030 by 3.4\%-8.0\%, and deaths by 3.0\%-7.2\%. CONCLUSIONS: A non-trivial proportion of TB results from transmission in clinics in the study community, particularly in HIV-positive people. Implementing IPC interventions could lead to moderate reductions in disease burden. We recommend that IPC measures in clinics should be implemented for their benefits to staff and patients, but also for their likely effects on TB incidence and mortality in the surrounding community.},

We estimate that IPC interventions could reduce incident TB cases in the community in 2021-2030 by 3.4\%-8.0\%, and deaths by 3.0\%-7.2\%. Conclusions: A non-trivial proportion of TB results from transmission in clinics in the study community, particularly in HIV-positive people. Implementing IPC interventions could lead to moderate reductions in disease burden. We recommend that IPC measures in clinics should be implemented for their benefits to staff and patients, but also for their likely effects on TB incidence and mortality in the surrounding community.}

Molecular studies suggest that only around 8\textendash 19\% of transmission to adults occurs within-household, or between known social-contacts. This contrasts with findings from social-contact studies, which show that substantial proportions of contact time occur in households, workplaces and schools. A mathematical model of social-contact behaviour and Mtb transmission was developed, incorporating variation in susceptibility and infectiousness. Three types of contact were simulated: household, repeated (individuals outside household contacted repeatedly with daily-monthly frequency) and non-repeated. The model was parameterised using data from Cape Town, South Africa, on mean and variance in contact numbers and contact durations, by contact type, and fitted to an estimate of overdispersion in numbers of secondary cases (`superspreading') in Cape Town. Household, repeated, and non-repeated contacts contributed 36\%, 13\%, and 51\% of contact time, and 13\%, 8\%, and 79\% of disease, respectively. Results suggest contact saturation, exacerbated by long disease durations and superspreading, cause the high proportion of transmission between non-repeated contacts.

  abstract = {When an individual is exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) three outcomes are possible: Bacterial clearance, active disease, or latent infection. It is generally believed that most individuals exposed to Mtb become latently infected and carry the mycobacteria for life. How Mtb is maintained during this latent infection remains largely unknown. During an Mtb infection in mice, there is a phase of rapid increase in bacterial numbers in the murine lungs within the first 3 weeks, and then bacterial numbers either stabilize or increase slowly over the period of many months. It has been debated whether the relatively constant numbers of bacteria in the chronic infection result from latent (dormant, quiescent), non-replicating bacteria, or whether the observed Mtb cell numbers are due to balance between rapid replication and death. A recent study of mice, infected with a Mtb strain carrying an unstable plasmid, showed that during the chronic phase, Mtb was replicating at significant rates. Using experimental data from this study and mathematical modeling we investigated the limits of the rates of bacterial replication, death, and quiescence during Mtb infection of mice. First, we found that to explain the data the rates of bacterial replication and death could not be constant and had to decrease with time since infection unless there were large changes in plasmid segregation probability over time. While a decrease in the rate of Mtb replication with time since infection was expected due to depletion of host's resources, a decrease in the Mtb death rate was counterintuitive since Mtb-specific immune response, appearing in the lungs 3-4 weeks after infection, should increase removal of bacteria. Interestingly, we found no significant correlation between estimated rates of Mtb replication and death suggesting the decline in these rates was driven by independent mechanisms. Second, we found that the data could not be explained by assuming that bacteria do not die, suggesting that some removal of bacteria from lungs of these mice had to occur even though the total bacterial counts in these mice always increased over time. Third and finally, we showed that to explain the data the majority of bacterial cells (at least \textasciitilde 60\%) must be replicating in the chronic phase of infection further challenging widespread belief of nonreplicating Mtb in latency. Our predictions were robust to some changes in the structure of the model, for example, when the loss of plasmid-bearing cells was mainly due to high fitness cost of the plasmid. Further studies should determine if more mechanistic models for Mtb dynamics are also able to accurately explain these data.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2016 McDaniel, Krishna, Handagama, Eda and Ganusov.},

If disability-adjusted life year (DALY) calculations are carried out for each condition separately, multimorbidity may lead to an overestimation of the morbidity component, the Years Lived with Disability (YLD). Adjusting for comorbidity may be straightforward if all symptoms have same onset and duration; however, when the comorbid health states occur at different time points, an analytical solution to the comorbidity problem becomes more complex. The aim of this study was to develop an individual-based modelling (IBM) approach to adjust incidence-based disease burden estimation for multimorbidity that allows simulating hypothetical individuals and tracking their disease history, including possible comorbidities, over time. Methods We demonstrated the IBM approach using an example of external comorbidity, i.e., colon cancer comorbid with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) and by assuming an independent multiplicative model. First, each cumulative progression probabilities were converted to a daily transition probabilities. Second, disability weights for simultaneously experienced health states and duration in each health state were determined. Third, YLD, adjusted for comorbidity, was calculated at every time step. We simulated a cohort of 1000 colorectal cancer patients aged 65\,years. Ninety-five percent uncertainty intervals around median YLD values were estimated by Monte Carlo methods. Results The median estimated YLD per 1000 cases (due to both cancer and HAP) adjusted for co-morbidity was 545 YLD/1000 (95\% interval: 513\textendash 585).

A Reed-Frost type model of disease spread is used to construct a simulation of the spread tuberculosis within three prehistoric populations of the Lower Illinois River Valley during Middle Woodland, Late Woodland, and Mississippian times. A high and low population size was modeled for each time period. Late Woodland model 2 (low population estimate) is the only model that experienced pathogen extinction with host survival. The rest of the models experienced rapid and severe host population decline. The results of the simulation suggest that a social network size of between 180 and 440 persons is required under the conditions of this model for host-pathogen coexistence (i.e., endemicity) to occur. The severe population decline experienced by these populations suggests that tuberculosis as modeled here could not have existed in these populations. Future refinements of modeling and simulation techniques can provide additional insights into how disease spreads among social contacts.},

Most recently, new models have been developed that consider host\textendash pathogen interactions at two levels simultaneously: both within-host dynamics and between-host transmissions. Infectious disease models vary widely in their complexity, in their attempts to refer to data from real-life infections and in their focus on problems of an applied or more fundamental nature. This entry will focus on simpler models tightly tied to data and aimed at addressing well-defined practical problems.},

This study systematically reviews the application of the ABM paradigm in 86 mobility transition studies. The study reveals several research gaps and proposes avenues for future research. Our review highlights that (i) the field has considerably matured in studying the diffusion of electric vehicles, (ii) both price-based and preference-based scenarios for mobility transition should be considered in future research, (iii) most of the empirical model calibrations have been confined to Western countries. Not only will the literature benefit from similar research in other Western regions, but also from non-Western nations with their unique mobility transition pathways, (iv) the conceptual modelling framework of studies can be divided into the two categories of theory-driven and heuristic models. The theory-driven models, which include psychological and non-psychological (e.g., activity-based travel) models, tend to use well-established behavioural rules, (v) most of the models have used the random utility maximization concept, social psychological models, and other simple assumptions/thresholds for the decision-making process of agents, (vi) half of the studies did not validate their models, and (vii) two-thirds of studies omitted to discuss interaction topology among agents. Major remaining challenges and gaps are identified in the review.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To forecast and better understand the primary drivers of the incidence and prevalence of and mortality from drug sensitive and multidrug resistant tuberculosis (DS-TB and MDR-TB, respectively). METHOD(S): The Tuberculosis Simulation Model (TBSM) is a dynamic disease simulation model that uses historical and current disease incidence, treatment success rates, mortality, and transmission trends and can account for expected market events to estimate future DS-TB and MDR-TB incidence, prevalence and mortality in China. RESULT(S): The model shows that between 2010 and 2050, DS-TB incidence, prevalence and mortality will decrease by 29\%, 52\% and 29\%, respectively, whereas MDR-TB incidence, prevalence and mortality will fall by 3\%, -11\% and 10\%, respectively. These reductions would be driven by an expected decrease in the pool of people with latent infection (brought about by improved cure rates which in turn reduces transmission rates) and reduced rate of progression from latent to active TB. CONCLUSION(S): Results from this model demonstrate considerable anticipated decreases in DS-TB and MDR-TB incidence and mortality in China over the next forty years; the decreases are much larger for DS-TB than for MDR-TB. Improvements in MDR-TB diagnosis and improved cure rates due to better MDR-TB treatments can likewise be expected to decrease MDR-TB incidence, prevalence and mortality over the long run. This adaptable TBSM tool has potential value in public health practice by forecasting outcomes of interventions and can also be useful for cost effectiveness modeling by country or by region by defining critical unmet need.},

A consequence of inadequately treated drug-susceptible TB (DS-TB) is multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). OBJECTIVE(S): To improve our understanding of the primary drivers of incidence and prevalence of DS- and MDR-TB in China. METHOD(S): The Tuberculosis Disease Transmission Model (TBDTM) uses historical and currentdisease epidemiology and transmission trends and treatment effectiveness, and accounts for annual changes to these to estimate future DS-TB and MDR-TB burden. RESULT(S): The model shows that in China, by 2050, incidence, prevalence and mortality of DS-TB will decrease by 32\%, 50\% and 41\%, respectively, whereas MDR-TB will increase by respectively 60\%, 48\% and 35\%. Reduction in DS-TB is a result of high treatment and cure rates leading to a decrease in the prevalence of latent tuberculous infection (LTBI), while the increase in MDR-TB is attributed to inappropriate treatment, leading to high transmission of infection and increased LTBI prevalence. CONCLUSION(S): These results demonstrate a reduction in DS-TB in China over the next 40 years, while MDRTB will increase. Improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of MDR-TB are needed to counter this threat. The TBDTM tool has potential value in public health practice by demonstrating the impact of interventions and estimating their cost-effectiveness. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Union.},

While some have argued that such deferred BDQ use allows a second line of defense with a potent drug, this strategy may not be optimal. OBJECTIVE : To compare several distinct scenarios of BDQ access and use, and their potential impact on the MDR-TB disease burden and the associated net economic benefit in India. METHOD(S): We used a state-Transition model to carry out this evaluation. The scenarios differed in the timing and breadth of BDQ access. RESULT S : The simulations showed that a strategy reliant on reserving the use of BDQ for those who have failed other MDR-TB regimens is likely to result in worse treatment outcomes for patients and in inferior public health outcomes for communities, leading to reduced net monetary benefit. CONCLUS ION: Our study suggests that deferring patient access to new drugs such as BDQ until front-line regimens have failed, in order to 'save' these drugs for later use, could be detrimental to patients and to public health, and could reduce the economic benefit of treating MDR-TB.},

We review here the historical evolution of this field, examine the basic structure of a simplified individual-based model of plant water transport, highlight selected applications for specific ecological problems and conclude by examining outstanding issues requiring further improvements in modelling vegetation water fluxes. We particularly emphasise issues related to the scaling from tissue-level traits to individual-based predictions of water transport, the representation of nonlinear and hysteretic behaviour in soil-xylem hydraulics and the need to incorporate knowledge of hydraulics within broader frameworks of plant ecological strategies and their consequences for predicting community demography and dynamics.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2019 The Authors.

We used a detailed simulation model allowing for changes in TB transmission, immigration, and other TB risk determinants. Five hypothetical scenarios were evaluated from 2017 to 2100: 1) maintain current TB prevention and treatment activities (base case); 2) provision of latent TB infection testing and treatment for new legal immigrants; 3) increased uptake of latent TB infection screening and treatment among high-risk populations, including a 3-month isoniazid-rifapentine regimen; 4) improved TB case detection; and 5) improved TB treatment quality. Under the base case, we estimate that by 2050, TB incidence will decline to 14 cases per million, a 52\% (95\% posterior interval (PI): 35, 67) reduction from 2016, and 82\% (95\% posterior interval: 78, 86) of incident TB will be among persons born outside of the United States. Intensified TB control could reduce incidence by 77\% (95\% posterior interval: 66, 85) by 2050. We predict TB may be eliminated in US-born but not non-US-born persons by 2100. Results were sensitive to numbers of people entering the United States with latent or active TB, and were robust to alternative interpretations of epidemiologic evidence.

  abstract = {Mathematical models can aid in elucidating the spread of infectious disease dynamics within a given population over time. In an attempt to model tuberculosis (TB) dynamics among high-burden districts in the Ashanti Region of Ghana, the SEIR epidemic model with demography was employed within both deterministic and stochastic settings for comparison purposes. The deterministic model showed success in modelling TB infection in the region to the transmission dynamics of the stochastic SEIR model over time. It predicted tuberculosis dying out in ten of twelve high-burden districts in the Ashanti Region, but an outbreak in Obuasi municipal and Amansie West district. The effect of introducing treatment at the incubation stage of TB transmission was also investigated, and it was discovered that treatment introduced at the exposed stage decreased the spread of TB. Branching process approximation was used to derive explicit forms of relevant epidemiological quantities of the deterministic SEIR model for stability analysis of equilibrium points. Numerical simulations were performed to validate the overall infection rate, basic reproductive number, herd immunity threshold, and Malthusian parameter based on bootstrapping, jackknife, and Latin Hypercube sampling schemes. It was recommended that the Ghana Health Service should find a good mechanism to detect TB in the early stages of infection in the region. Public health attention must also be given to districts with a potentially higher risk of experiencing endemic TB even though the estimates of the overall epidemic thresholds from our SEIR model suggested that the Ashanti Region as a whole had herd immunity against TB infection.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020 Felix Okoe Mettle et al.},

  abstract = {According to WHO estimates, in 2010 there were 8.8 million new cases of tuberculosis (TB) and 1.5 million deaths. TB has been classically associated with poverty, overcrowding and malnutrition. Low income countries and deprived areas, within big cities in developed countries, present the highest TB incidences and TB mortality rates. These are the settings where immigration, important social inequalities, HIV infection and drug or alcohol abuse may coexist, all factors strongly associated with TB. In spite of the political, economical, research and community efforts, TB remains a major global health problem worldwide. Moreover, in this new century, new challenges such as multidrug-resistance extension, migration to big cities and the new treatments with anti-tumour necrosis alpha factor for inflammatory diseases have emerged and threaten the decreasing trend in the global number of TB cases in the last years. We must also be aware about the impact that smoking and diabetes pandemics may be having on the incidence of TB. The existence of a good TB Prevention and Control Program is essential to fight against TB. The coordination among clinicians, microbiologists, epidemiologists and others, and the link between surveillance, control and research should always be a priority for a TB Program. Each city and country should define their needs according to the epidemiological situation. Local TB control programs will have to adapt to any new challenge that arises in order to respond to the needs of their population.},

A several-month daily course of a single drug during latent infection (i.e. isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT)) has proved in clinical trials to substantially reduce an HIV-infected individual's risk of TB disease. As a result of these findings and ongoing studies, the World Health Organization has produced strong guidelines for implementing IPT on a community-wide scale for individuals with HIV at risk of TB disease. To date, there has been limited use of IPT at a community-wide level. In this paper, we present a new co-network model for HIV and TB co-epidemics to address questions about how the population-level impact of community-wide IPT may differ from the individual-level impact of IPT offered to selected individuals. In particular, we examine how the effect of clustering of contacts within high-TB incidence communities may affect the rates of re-infection with TB and how this clustering modifies the expected population-level effects of IPT. We find that populations with clustering of respiratory contacts experience aggregation of TB cases and high numbers of re-infection events. While, encouragingly, the overall population-level effects of community-wide IPT appear to be sustained regardless of network structure, we find that in populations where these contacts are highly clustered, there is dramatic heterogeneity in the impact of IPT: in some sub-regions of these populations, TB is nearly eliminated, while in others, repeated re-infection almost completely undermines the effect of IPT. Our findings imply that as IPT programmes are brought to scale, we should expect local heterogeneity of effectiveness as a result of the complex patterns of disease transmission within communities. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Royal Society.},

  abstract = {Human populations are interconnected through a variety of different networks. The complex interactions of diverse populations of individuals and their interconnected network structures affect the diffusion of processes through the population. For example, the different modes of transmission of HIV and TB mean that they are transmitted along very different contact networks: HIV via sexual contact and TB via respiratory contact. In addition, co-infection with HIV raises the risk of progressing to active TB and reduces the response to TB treatment, potentially causing increasing incidence of TB.Here we extend existing network theory to find the effect of multiple networks and multiple host types on epidemic thresholds. We first analyse how transmission of a pathogen via an additional network affects its epidemic threshold. We then use the theory behind branching processes to study how multiple host types in a population affect its threshold. The formulation we obtain enables modellers to determine how multiple networks and host heterogeneity (i.e. vaccination, behavioural change, mixing patterns, etc.) affect the epidemic threshold. We apply the results to the example of HIV and TB to illustrate how the interactions of the diseases can substantially alter the epidemic threshold of TB. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Despite the national efforts to reduce Tuberculosis (TB) patients, the number of patients in South Korea is considered the largest among OECD countries. Poor adherence to anti-tuberculosis treatment is an obstacle to tuberculosis control. Therefore, we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adherence to TB treatment by comparing adherent patients and non-adherent patients using simulation techniques. Method(s): We targeted newly-treated TB patients. A discrete-event simulation model was built to compare adherent patients and non-adherent patients to TB treatment. We considered treatment completion, loss to follow-up, recurrence, death, and treatment changes from drug-susceptible TB to Multidrug resistance (MDR) TB. Through analyzing claims data from Korean nationwide health insurance from 2007 to 2015, we obtained TB-related costs and distributions of time-to-event such as death, recurrence, or treatment completion. Utilities from the previous study were adapted. Ten thousand patients who started TB treatments in each group were ten times simulated until 100 years old or death. We estimated the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs for each group and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as an index of cost-effectiveness. The model was developed with R software. Result(s): Average TB-related costs per TB patient were US\$ 2,966 and US\$ 5,782 in the adherent and the non-adherent groups. QALYs per patient were 32.7 and 31.3, respectively. When comparing the adherent group with the non-adherent group, ICER was US\$ -1,950 per QALY. Conclusion(s): Adherence to TB treatments is cost-effective with less cost and more QALY gained. Commitment programs to improve patients' adherence can be helpful to manage TB nationwide.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2021},

This study aims to predict the number of TB cases in Gombak based on sociodemographic and environmental factors. Method(s): The sociodemographic data of 3325 TB cases from January 2013 to December 2017 in Gombak district were collected from the MyTB web and TB Information System database. Environmental data were obtained from the Department of Environment, Malaysia; Department of Irrigation and Drainage, Malaysia; and Malaysian Metrological Department from July 2012 to December 2017. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) were used to develop the prediction model of TB cases. The models that used sociodemographic variables as the input datasets were referred as MLR1 and ANN1, whereas environmental variables were represented as MLR2 and ANN2 and both sociodemographic and environmental variables together were indicated as MLR3 and ANN3. Result(s): The ANN was found to be superior to MLR with higher adjusted coefficient of determination (R 2) values in predicting TB cases; the ranges were from 0.35 to 0.47 compared to 0.07 to 0.14, respectively. The best TB prediction model, that is, ANN3 was derived from nationality, residency, income status, CO, NO 2, SO 2, PM 10, rainfall, temperature, and atmospheric pressure, with the highest adjusted R 2 value of 0.47, errors below 6, and accuracies above 96\%. Conclusion(s): It is envisaged that the application of the ANN algorithm based on both sociodemographic and environmental factors may enable a more accurate modeling for predicting TB cases.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

  abstract = {Despite the usefulness of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in the study of various complex problems, ANNs have not been applied for modeling the geographic distribution of tuberculosis (TB) in the US. Likewise, ecological level researches on TB incidence rate at the national level are inadequate for epidemiologic inferences. We collected 278 exploratory variables including environmental and a broad range of socio-economic features for modeling the disease across the continental US. The spatial pattern of the disease distribution was statistically evaluated using the global Moran's I, Getis-Ord General G, and local Gi* statistics. Next, we investigated the applicability of multilayer perceptron (MLP) ANN for predicting the disease incidence. To avoid overfitting, L1 regularization was used before developing the models. Predictive performance of the MLP was compared with linear regression for test dataset using root mean square error, mean absolute error, and correlations between model output and ground truth. Results of clustering analysis showed that there is a significant spatial clustering of smoothed TB incidence rate (p {$<$} 0.05) and the hotspots were mainly located in the southern and southeastern parts of the country. Among the developed models, single hidden layer MLP had the best test accuracy. Sensitivity analysis of the MLP model showed that immigrant population (proportion), underserved segments of the population, and minimum temperature were among the factors with the strongest contributions. The findings of this study can provide useful insight to health authorities on prioritizing resource allocation to risk-prone areas.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2019 by the authors.

  abstract = {Background: Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) reduces mortality among people living with HIV (PLHIV) and is recommended for those without active tuberculosis (TB) symptoms. Heavy alcohol use, however, is contraindicated for liver toxicity concerns. We evaluated the risks and benefits of IPT at antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation to ART alone for PLHIV who are heavy drinkers in 3 high TB-/HIV-burden countries. Method(s): We developed a Markov simulation model to compare ART alone to ART with either 6 or 36 months of IPT for heavy drinking PLHIV enrolling in care in Brazil, India, and Uganda. Outcomes included nonfatal toxicity, fatal toxicity, life expectancy, TB cases, and TB death. Result(s): In this simulation, 6 months of IPT + ART (IPT6) extended life expectancy over both ART alone and 36 months of IPT + ART (IPT36) in India and Uganda, but ART alone dominated in Brazil in 51.5\% of simulations. Toxicity occurred in 160/1000 persons on IPT6 and 415/1000 persons on IPT36, with fatal toxicity in 8/1000 on IPT6 and 21/1000 on IPT36. Sensitivity analyses favored IPT6 in India and Uganda with high toxicity thresholds. Conclusion(s): The benefits of IPT for heavy drinkers outweighed its risks in India and Uganda when given for a 6-month course. The toxicity/efficacy trade-off was less in Brazil where TB incidence is lower. IPT6 resulted in fatal toxicity in 8/1000 people, whereas even higher toxicities of IPT36 negated its benefits in all countries. Data to better characterize IPT toxicity among HIV-infected drinkers are needed to improve guidance.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

This paper provides an overview of the TB epidemiological situation in the Western Pacific Region and of progress towards the 2020 milestones of the Strategy. A descriptive analysis was conducted of TB surveillance and programme data reported to WHO and estimates of the TB burden generated by WHO for the period 2000\textendash 2018. An estimated 1.8 million people developed TB and 90 000 people died from it in the Region in 2018. Since 2015, the estimated TB incidence rate and the estimated number of TB deaths in the Region decreased by 3\% and 10\%, with annual reduction rates of 1.0\% and 3.4\%, respectively. With current efforts, the Region is unlikely to achieve the 2020 milestones and other targets of the Strategy. Major challenges include: (1) wide variation in the geographical distribution and rate of TB incidence among countries; (2) a substantial proportion (23\%) of TB cases that remain unreached, undiagnosed or unreported; (3) insufficient coverage of drug susceptibility testing (51\%) for bacteriologically confirmed cases and limited use of WHO-recommended rapid diagnostics (11 countries reported {$<~$}60\% coverage); (4) suboptimal treatment outcomes of TB (60\% of countries reported {$<~$}85\% success), of TB/HIV co-infection (79\%) and of multidrug- or rifampicin-resistant TB (59\%); (5) limited coverage of TB preventive treatment among people living with HIV (39\%) and child contacts (12\%); and (6) substantial proportions (35\textendash 70\%) of TB-affected families facing catastrophic costs. For the Region to stay on track to achieve the End TB Strategy targets, an accelerated multisectoral response to TB is required in every country.},

The clinical impact of such variability on serial testing remains unknown. We used a microsimulation Markov model that accounts for major sources of variability to project diagnostic outcomes in a simulated North American HCW cohort. Serial testing using a single QFT with the recommended conversion cutoff (IFN-g{$>$}0.35IU/mL) resulted in 24.6\% (95\% uncertainty range, UR: 23.8-25.5) of the entire population testing false-positive over ten years. Raising the cutoff to {$>$}1.0IU/mL or confirming initial positive results with a (presumed independent) second test reduced this false-positive percentage to 2.3\% (95\%UR: 2.0-2.6\%) or 4.1\% (95\%UR: 3.7-4.5\%), but also reduced the proportion of true incident infections detected within the first year of infection from 76.5\% (95\%UR: 66.3-84.6\%) to 54.8\% (95\%UR: 44.6-64.5\%) or 61.5\% (95\%UR: 51.6-70.9\%), respectively. Serial QFT testing of HCWs in North America may result in tremendous over-diagnosis and over-treatment of LTBI, with nearly thirty false-positives for every true infection diagnosed. Using higher cutoffs for conversion or confirmatory tests (for initial positives) can mitigate these effects, but will also diagnose fewer true infections.},

Routine testing for the harmful pathogen Bovine Tuberculosis (bTB) was suspended briefly during the foot and mouth disease epidemic of 2001 in Great Britain. Here we utilize bTB incidence data and mathematical models to demonstrate how a lapse in management can alter epidemiological parameters, including the rate of new infections and duration of infection cycles. Testing interruption shifted the dynamics from annual to 4-year cycles, and created long-lasting shifts in the spatial synchrony of new infections among regions of Great Britain. After annual testing was introduced in some GB regions, new infections have become more de-synchronised, a result also confirmed by a stochastic model. These results demonstrate that abrupt events can synchronise disease dynamics and that changes in the epidemiological parameters can lead to chaotic patterns, which are hard to be quantified, predicted, and controlled.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2018, The Author(s).},

These host characteristics include interventions such as chemotherapy, vaccination and chemoprophylaxis, HIV prevalence, the age structure of the population, and the prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection. We consider the implications of these results for the interpretation of cluster studies of M. tuberculosis as well as the more general application of microsimulation models to infectious disease epidemiology.}

  abstract = {This paper presents the results of an economic simulation model evaluating the costs and benefits of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) control in a wildlife-livestock interface area of Southern Zambia over a 10 year period, using test and slaughter in livestock and promotion of milk pasteurization amongst livestock keeping communities to reduce the zoonotic transmission of bTB through milk. Expected benefits included increased productivity and health in village resident and transhumant cattle, and averted human bTB treatment costs after the fourth year of the project. In monetary terms, at different bTB prevalence estimates in cattle, the simulation outcome showed that the costs of control never exceeded the few benefits considered over the simulated period. However, the benefits are likely to outweigh the costs if wider implications of bTB in humans (infirmity-related productivity losses), livestock and wildlife (reduced productivity and herd value in cattle and diminished tourism potential from bTB-related wildlife mortalities) are taken into account. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {In Spain, the eradication of tuberculosis (TB) in cattle has had some setbacks and therefore we need to re-evaluate the current surveillance strategies. The Spanish cattle TB surveillance system consists of three components: a) routine skin testing, b) slaughterhouse surveillance, and c) pre-movement controls. Our objectives were to assess the effectiveness of the whole surveillance system and evaluate the relative contribution of each of those components, both at national and at the province level. The effectiveness was estimated based on both the sensitivity of detection per year and the time until detection. Moreover, we evaluated the impact of different factors on that effectiveness. We used a stochastic model that simulated the spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-complex (MTC) infection within cattle herds that was modified to incorporate the three components of TB surveillance. Input data, at the province level, on cattle movements off-farm or the frequency of the routine screening were provided by the Spanish Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Under the current conditions, 96.1\% of Spanish herds were detected within one year after their infection (i.e. mean sensitivity of TB surveillance), although that detection took on average 178 days. The surveillance system effectiveness was highly dependent on the routine skin testing, responsible for the detection of almost 90\% of the infected herds, while slaughterhouse surveillance and pre-movement controls contributed only to the identification of a small proportion of infected herds. We observed substantial differences in the effectiveness of the surveillance components among Spanish provinces, although in general, the sensitivities were high. The most influential factor on the efficiency of TB detection in Spain was, by far, the frequency of routine controls, followed by the sensitivity of the test used. In a context of reduced funding for cattle TB eradication, the frequency of testing should be adapted based on risk-based surveillance strategies, i.e. efforts should focus on herds more likely to be infected, but also in herds more likely to infect other herds. While slaughterhouse surveillance seems a cost-effective strategy, the use of pre-movement testing at least in areas of low incidence should be further evaluated.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2019 The Authors},

  abstract = {The risk of progression from exposure to the tuberculosis bacilli to the development of active disease is a two-stage process governed by both exogenous and endogenous risk factors. Exogenous factors play a key role in accentuating the progression from exposure to infection among which the bacillary load in the sputum and the proximity of an individual to an infectious TB case are key factors. Similarly endogenous factors lead in progression from infection to active TB disease. Along with well-established risk factors (such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malnutrition, and young age), emerging variables such as diabetes, indoor air pollution, alcohol, use of immunosuppressive drugs, and tobacco smoke play a significant role at both the individual and population level. Socioeconomic and behavioral factors are also shown to increase the susceptibility to infection. Specific groups such as health care workers and indigenous population are also at an increased risk of TB infection and disease. This paper summarizes these factors along with health system issues such as the effects of delay in diagnosis of TB in the transmission of the bacilli.},

  abstract = {Patterns of transmission of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) remain poorly understood, despite over half a million incident cases worldwide in 2017. Modeling TB transmission networks can provide insight into drivers of transmission, but incomplete sampling of TB cases can pose challenges for inference from individual epidemiologic and molecular data. We assessed the effect of missing cases on a transmission network inferred from Mycobacterium tuberculosis sequencing data on extensively drug-resistant TB cases in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, diagnosed in 2011-2014. We tested scenarios in which cases were missing at random, missing differentially by clinical characteristics, or missing differentially by transmission (i.e., cases with many links were under- or oversampled). Under the assumption that cases were missing randomly, the mean number of transmissions per case in the complete network needed to be larger than 20, far higher than expected, to reproduce the observed network. Instead, the most likely scenario involved undersampling of high-transmitting cases, and models provided evidence for super-spreading. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis to have assessed support for different mechanisms of missingness in a TB transmission study, but our results are subject to the distributional assumptions of the network models we used. Transmission studies should consider the potential biases introduced by incomplete sampling and identify host, pathogen, or environmental factors driving super-spreading.Copyright \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2020.

We measured a network of genomic links using Mycobacterium tuberculosis whole-genome sequences. Results. Patients with 2-3 months of cough or who spent time in urban locations were more likely to be linked in the network, while patients with sputum smear-positive disease were less likely to be linked than those with smear-negative disease. Associations persisted using different thresholds to define genomic links and irrespective of assumptions about the direction of transmission. Conclusions.

The current TB burden is unknown as not all individuals with TB are diagnosed, recorded and notified. The second national TB prevalence survey was conducted in 2017\textendash 2018 to assess the current burden of TB disease in the country. Method Eighty-two clusters were selected using a multistage cluster sampling design. Adult ({$\geq$}15 years of age) residents having lived for 2 weeks or more in the households of the selected clusters were invited to participate in the survey. The survey participants were screened for TB by a questionnaire and digital chest X-ray after providing written informed consent. Individuals with a positive symptom screen and/or chest X-ray suggestive of TB were asked to provide sputum samples to test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis by Ziehl-Neelsen direct light microscopy, Xpert MTB/RIF G4, BACTEC MGIT960 liquid culture and L\"owenstein-Jensen solid culture. Bacteriologically confirmed TB cases were defined by an expert panel following a standard decision tree. Result Of 87,207 eligible residents, 61,763 (70.8\%) participated, and 4,738 (7.7\%) screened positive for TB. Among these, 221 participants were defined as bacteriologically confirmed TB cases. The estimated prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed adult pulmonary TB was 322 (95\% CI: 260\textendash 399) per 100,000, and the male-to-female ratio was 4.0 (2.8\textendash 5.8, p{$<$}0.001). In-depth interviews with the participants with TB disease showed that only 57.9\% (95\% CI: 51.3\textendash 64.3\%) reported cough for 2 weeks or more and 32.1\% (26.3\textendash 38.6\%) did not report any symptom consistent with TB, while their chest X-ray results showed that 97.7\% (95\% CI: 94.6\textendash 99.1) had abnormal chest X-ray images suggesting TB. Conclusion With highly sensitive diagnostics applied, this survey showed that the TB burden in Vietnam remains high. Half of the TB cases were not picked up by general symptom-based screening and were identified by chest X-ray only. Our results indicate that improving TB diagnostic capacity and access to care, along with reducing TB stigma, need to be top priorities for TB control and elimination in Vietnam.},

METHOD(S): We obtained high-resolution spatial and epidemiological data on health services, population, transport network, topography, land cover and paediatric fever treatment in four Kenyan districts to develop access and use models for government health services in Kenya. Community survey data were used to model use of government health services by febrile children. A model based on the transport network was then implemented and adjusted for actual use patterns. We compared the predictive accuracy of this refined model to that of Euclidean distance metrics. RESULT(S): Higher-order facilities were more attractive to patients (54\%, 58\% and 60\% in three scenarios) than lower-order ones. The transport network model, adjusted for competition between facilities, was most accurate and selected as the best-fit model. It estimated that 63\% of the population of the study districts were within the 1 h national access benchmark, against 82\% estimated by the Euclidean model. CONCLUSION(S): Extrapolating the results from the best-fit model in study districts to the national level shows that approximately six million people are currently incorrectly estimated to have access to government health services within 1 h. Simple Euclidean distance assumptions, which underpin needs assessments and against which millennium development goals are evaluated, thus require reconsideration. \textcopyright{} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Established foci of Mycobacterium bovis (the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis [bTB]) in free-ranging wildlife are currently under various stages of management on three continents (Africa, Europe and North America) and in New Zealand. Other, as yet undiagnosed, foci seem likely to exist elsewhere. The complex roles that these wildlife foci play in the ecology of bTB remain among the greatest challenges facing bTB control globally.Conceptually, management of bTB in free-ranging wildlife can be thought of as progressing from the discovery of an outbreak through frequently overlapping stages of epidemiological characterization, initial control, simulation and forecasting, focused control, and verification of eradication. Surveillance in its various forms remains a critical component of assessment throughout. Since the Fourth International M. bovis Conference in 2005, research on management of bTB in free-ranging wildlife has encompassed such areas as the human dimensions of wildlife management, mitigation of bTB risks from wildlife on cattle farms, vaccine biology, and epidemiology, with a major contribution from simulation modeling. In order to advance the actual field management of bTB, however, research must be sufficiently grounded to aid development of practical, affordable and politically defensible management interventions which stand a reasonable chance of being implemented.The current management of two wildlife reservoirs of bTB, brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) in New Zealand, and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Michigan, USA, serve as contrasting examples of different wildlife management strategies aimed at achieving a common goal. In New Zealand, the importance of agricultural export markets and the status of the possum as a non-native pest have facilitated direct, aggressive management of the disease reservoir, resulting in considerable progress towards bTB freedom since 1994. In Michigan, the relative importance of the hunting economy and of whitetails as a game animal have made such aggressive culling politically untenable. This has forced reliance upon publicly supported, and implemented, management tools, and so provided impetus to better understand social support for wildlife management policy, its limitations, and ways to employ it in disease control policy development. \textcopyright{} 2011.},

  abstract = {In recent years, Biomathematics has become the main important trend of research direction which has applied to the epidemic models of disease mechanism, spreading regulation, and strategy of disease preventing in the field of medical and public health. The paper will apply Liapunov stability function to construct a dynamic mathematics models for tuberculosis and to meet the above-mentioned TB disease mechanism, spreading regulation, and strategy of disease preventing in the medical field. The theory of Liapunov stability function is a general rule and method to examine and determine the stability characteristics of a dynamic system. In order to simulate the transmissions of vector-borne diseases and discuss the related health policies effects on vector-borne diseases, we combine the multi-agent-based system, social network, and compartmental model to develop an epidemic simulation model. In the identity level, we use the multi-agent-based system and the mirror identity concept to describe identities with social network features such as daily visits, longdistance movement, high degree of clustering, low degree of separation, and local clustering. The research will analyze the complex dynamic mathematic model of tuberculosis epidemic and determine its stability property by using the popular Matlab/Simulink software and relative software packages. Facing to the currently TB epidemic situation, in this project we will investgate the development of TB and its developing trend throught constructing the dynamic biomathematics system model of TB. After we simulated the development of epidemic situation with the solution of SIMR epidemic model, we will come up a good plan to control epidemic situation to analyze the parameter values of model that influence epidemic situation evolved. We will try to find the quarantining parameters wich are the most important factors to control epidemic situation, as shown in the examples. The SICR epidemic model and the results of experiment by numerical analysis may offer some prevention with reference to control epidemic situation of Tuberculosis.},

  abstract = {Simulation models are useful in policy planning for tuberculosis (TB) control. To accurately assess interventions, important modifiers of the epidemic should be accounted for in evaluative models. Improvements in population health were associated with the declining TB epidemic in the pre-antibiotic era and may be relevant today. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a TB transmission model that accounted for changes in population health. We developed a deterministic TB transmission model, using reported data from the pre-antibiotic era in England. Change in adjusted life expectancy, used as a proxy for general health, was used to determine the rate of change of key epidemiological parameters. Predicted outcomes included risk of TB infection and TB mortality. The model was validated in the setting of the Netherlands and then applied to modern Peru. The model, developed in the setting of England, predicted TB trends in the Netherlands very accurately. The R(2) value for correlation between observed and predicted data was 0.97 and 0.95 for TB infection and mortality, respectively. In Peru, the predicted decline in incidence prior to the expansion of "Directly Observed Treatment Short Course" (The DOTS strategy) was 3.7\% per year (observed = 3.9\% per year). After DOTS expansion, the predicted decline was very similar to the observed decline of 5.8\% per year. We successfully developed and validated a TB model, which uses a proxy for population health to estimate changes in key epidemiology parameters. Population health contributed significantly to improvement in TB outcomes observed in Peru. Changing population health should be incorporated into evaluative models for global TB control.},

Due to slow progression of tuberculosis, the transmission dynamics and its long-term effects can often be better observed and predicted using simulations of epidemiological models. This study provides a review of earlier study on modeling different aspects of tuberculosis dynamics. The models simulate tuberculosis transmission dynamics, treatment, drug resistance, control strategies for increasing compliance to treatment, HIV/TB co-infection, and patient groups. The models are based on various mathematical systems, such as systems of ordinary differential equations, simulation models, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. The inferences from the models are justified by case studies and statistical analysis of TB patient datasets. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {The complexity and multiscale nature of the mammalian immune response provides an excellent test bed for the potential of mathematical modeling and simulation to facilitate mechanistic understanding. Historically, mathematical models of the immune response focused on subsets of the immune system and/or specific aspects of the response. Mathematical models have been developed for the humoral side of the immune response, or for the cellular side, or for cytokine kinetics, but rarely have they been proposed to encompass the overall system complexity. We propose here a framework for integration of subset models, based on a system biology approach. A dynamic simulator, the Fully-integrated Immune Response Model (FIRM), was built in a stepwise fashion by integrating published subset models and adding novel features. The approach used to build the model includes the formulation of the network of interacting species and the subsequent introduction of rate laws to describe each biological process. The resulting model represents a multi-organ structure, comprised of the target organ where the immune response takes place, circulating blood, lymphoid T, and lymphoid B tissue. The cell types accounted for include macrophages, a few T-cell lineages (cytotoxic, regulatory, helper 1, and helper 2), and B-cell activation to plasma cells. Four different cytokines were accounted for: IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-12. In addition, generic inflammatory signals are used to represent the kinetics of IL-1, IL-2, and TGF-beta. Cell recruitment, differentiation, replication, apoptosis and migration are described as appropriate for the different cell types. The model is a hybrid structure containing information from several mammalian species. The structure of the network was built to be physiologically and biochemically consistent. Rate laws for all the cellular fate processes, growth factor production rates and half-lives, together with antibody production rates and half-lives, are provided. The results demonstrate how this framework can be used to integrate mathematical models of the immune response from several published sources and describe qualitative predictions of global immune system response arising from the integrated, hybrid model. In addition, we show how the model can be expanded to include novel biological findings. Case studies were carried out to simulate TB infection, tumor rejection, response to a blood borne pathogen and the consequences of accounting for regulatory T-cells. The final result of this work is a postulated and increasingly comprehensive representation of the mammalian immune system, based on physiological knowledge and susceptible to further experimental testing and validation. We believe that the integrated nature of FIRM has the potential to simulate a range of responses under a variety of conditions, from modeling of immune responses after tuberculosis (TB) infection to tumor formation in tissues. FIRM also has the flexibility to be expanded to include both complex and novel immunological response features as our knowledge of the immune system advances.},

The objective of the study was to conduct a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of commonly administered treatment sequences among elderly mCRC patients. Method(s): A probabilistic discrete event simulation model assuming Weibull distribution was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of common treatment sequences: 1) first-line oxaliplatin/irinotecan followed by second-line oxaliplatin/irinotecan + bevacizumab (OI-OIB), 2) first-line oxaliplatin/irinotecan + bevacizumab followed by second-line oxaliplatin/irinotecan + bevacizumab (OIB-OIB), 3) OI-OIB followed by a third-line targeted biologic (OI-OIB-TB), and 4) OIB-OIB followed by a third-line targeted biologic (OIB-OIB-TB). Input parameters were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results - Medicare linked dataset for mCRC diagnosed from January 2004 through December 2009. Parameter uncertainty was accounted in a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Costs (2014 U.S. dollars) and effectiveness were discounted annually at 3\%. Result(s): In the base case analyses, at the willingnessto- pay (WTP) threshold of \$100,000/quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, the treatment sequence OIB-OIB (versus OI-OIB) was not cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per patient of \$119,007/QALY, OI-OIB-TB (versus OIB-OIB) was dominated and OIB-OIB-TB (versus OIB-OIB) was not cost-effective with an ICER of \$405,857/QALY. Similar results were obtained assuming Log-normal distribution. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves derived from probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at a WTP of \$100,000/QALY gained; sequence OI-OIB was 34\% cost-effective, followed by OIB-OIB (31\%), OI-OIB-TB (20\%), and OIB-OIB-TB (15\%). Conclusion(s): Treatment sequences with bevacizumab at first-line and targeted biologics at third-line may not be cost-effective at the commonly used threshold of \$100,000/QALY gained but a marginal decrease in the cost of bevacizumab may make treatment sequences with first-line bevacizumab cost-effective.

  abstract = {Objective: Targeted testing and treatment of persons with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is a critical component of the US tuberculosis (TB) elimination strategy. In January 2016, the California Department of Public Health issued a tool and user guide for TB risk assessment (California tool) and guidance for LTBI testing, and in September 2016, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued recommendations for LTBI testing in primary care settings. We estimated the epidemiologic effect of adherence to both recommendations in California. Method(s): We used an individual-based Markov micro-simulation model to estimate the number of cases of TB disease expected through 2026 with baseline LTBI strategies compared with implementation of the USPSTF or California tool guidance. We estimated the risk of LTBI by age and country of origin, the probability of being in a targeted population, and the probability of presenting for primary care based on available data. We assumed 100\% adherence to testing guidance but imperfect adherence to treatment. Result(s): Implementation of USPSTF and California tool guidance would result in nearly identical numbers of tests administered and cases of TB disease prevented. Perfect adherence to either recommendation would result in approximately 7000 cases of TB disease averted (40\% reduction compared with baseline) by 2026. Almost all of this decline would be driven by a reduction in the number of cases among non-US-born persons. Conclusion(s): By focusing on the non-US-born population, adherence to LTBI testing strategies recommended by the USPSTF and the California tool could substantially reduce the burden of TB disease in California in the next decade.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020, Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.}

A primary concern of epidemiologists is investigating the spread of infectious diseases. Computer Scientists can provide powerful tools for epidemiologists to study such diseases. The existing simulation approaches available to epidemiologists are fast becoming obsolete, with data being stored in newer formats like GIS formats. There is an urgent need for developing computationally powerful, user-friendly tools that can be used by epidemiologists to study the dynamics of disease spread. We present a survey of the state-of-the-art in agent-based modeling and discuss the unique features of our chosen technique. Our agent-based approach effectively models the dynamics of the spread of infectious diseases in spatially-delineated environments by using agents to model the interaction between people and pathogens. We present preliminary results of modeling an actual tuberculosis disease outbreak in a local shelter. This model is an important step in the development of user-friendly tools for epidemiologists.},

All strategies investigated were based on a test-and-cull approach using either the caudal-fold test (CFT), the single cervical test (SCT), the gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) test or a combination of these tests. The maximum, minimum and most-likely sensitivity and specificity were investigated in three scenarios simulating different epidemiological conditions. Simulation results were highly variable; therefore, it is difficult to predict the effect of disease-control strategies within individual herds. On average, the use of the SCT was less efficient in eradicating tuberculosis from the simulated herd than the CFT. Eradication would be achieved most efficiently by strategies in which the CFT was used assuming maximum possible sensitivity and specificity (difficult to achieve in the field) and/or the gamma-IFN test-which has both economical and logistical limitations to its widespread application in Argentina. When disease-control was simulated in situations in which herd tuberculosis prevalence is {$>$} or = 22\%, all strategies we simulated were less efficient than herd depopulation. Considering that Argentine dairy producers are not compensated financially for cattle culled because of tuberculosis, eradication strategies currently used in the Argentine national tuberculosis eradication might not succeed.},

Using estimates of Mycobacterium bovis transmission (beta) and a Reed-Frost simulation model, the prevalence of tuberculosis infection in the study herds over time was investigated. The Reed-Frost model was modified by incorporating randomness in both beta and the incubation period (alpha) of M. bovis. The mean estimated herd beta was 2.2 infective contacts per year and did not differ significantly between the study herds. Modeling alpha as Poisson distributed (mean 24 months) best fit the observed prevalences. Infection was predicted by the model either to spread quickly ({$<$}10 years) within a herd and reach a high prevalence ({$>$}50\%), or to persist at a low prevalence ({$<$}5-10\%). The model was robust, predictions were realistic and the mean beta estimated was consistent with previous studies of bovine tuberculosis.},

Our aim was to study the potential consequences of such monitoring strategies, especially in terms of survival and resistance development. Method(s): A validated computer simulation model of HIV infection and the effect of antiretroviral therapy was used to compare survival, use of second-line regimens, and development of resistance that result from different strategies-based on viral load, CD4 cell count, or clinical observation alone-for determining when to switch people starting antiretroviral treatment with the WHO-recommended first-line regimen of stavudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine to second-line antiretroviral treatment. Finding(s): Over 5 years, the predicted proportion of potential life-years survived was 83\% with viral load monitoring (switch when viral load {$>$}500 copies per mL), 82\% with CD4 cell count monitoring (switch at 50\% drop from peak), and 82\% with clinical monitoring (switch when two new WHO stage 3 events or a WHO stage 4 event occur). Corresponding values over 20 years were 67\%, 64\%, and 64\%. Findings were robust to variations in model specification in extensive univariable and multivariable sensitivity analyses. Although survival was slightly longer with viral load monitoring, this strategy was not the most cost effective. Interpretation(s): For patients on the first-line regimen of stavudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine the benefits of viral load or CD4 cell count monitoring over clinical monitoring alone are modest. Development of cheap and robust versions of these assays is important, but widening access to antiretrovirals-with or without laboratory monitoring-is currently the highest priority.

  abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) prevalence substantially increased over the past two decades with relatively high impact on large dairy herds, raising the concern of regulatory authorities and industry stakeholders, and threatening animal and public health. Lack of resources, together with the economic and social consequences of whole-herd stamping-out, makes depopulation an impractical disease control alternative in these herds. The increase in bTB prevalence was associated with demographic and management changes in the dairy industry in Uruguay, reducing the efficacy of the current control programme (i.e. status quo) based on intradermal serial testing with caudal fold- and comparative-cervical tuberculin test-and-slaughter of reactors (CFT-CCT). Here, we aimed to assess the epidemiological effectiveness of six alternative control scenarios based on test-and-slaughter of positive animals, using mathematical modelling to infer bTB-within-herd dynamics. We simulated six alternative control strategies consisting of testing adult cattle ({$>$}1 year) in the herd every 3 months using one test (in vivo or in vitro) or a combination in parallel of two tests (CFT, interferon-gamma release assay-IGRA- or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Results showed no significant differences overall in the time needed to reach bTB eradication (median ranging between 61 and 82 months) or official bovine tuberculosis-free status (two consecutive negative herd tests) between any of the alternative strategies and the status quo (median ranging between 50 and 59 months). However, we demonstrate how alternative strategies can significantly reduce bTB prevalence when applied for restricted periods (6, 12 or 24 months), and in the case of IGRAc (IGRA using peptide-cocktail antigens), without incurring on higher unnecessary slaughter of animals (false positives) than the status quo in the first 6 months of the programme (p-value {$<$}.05). Enhanced understanding bTB-within-herd dynamics with the application of different control strategies help to identify optimal strategies to ultimately improve bTB control and bTB eradication from dairies in Uruguay and similar endemic settings.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH},

  abstract = {Granulomas are complex lung lesions that are the hallmark of tuberculosis (TB). Understanding antibiotic dynamics within lung granulomas will be vital to improving and shortening the long course of TB treatment. Three fluoroquinolones (FQs) are commonly prescribed as part of multi-drug resistant TB therapy: moxifloxacin (MXF), levofloxacin (LVX) or gatifloxacin (GFX). To date, insufficient data are available to support selection of one FQ over another, or to show that these drugs are clinically equivalent. To predict the efficacy of MXF, LVX and GFX at a single granuloma level, we integrate computational modeling with experimental datasets into a single mechanistic framework, GranSim. GranSim is a hybrid agent-based computational model that simulates granuloma formation and function, FQ plasma and tissue pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and is based on extensive in vitro and in vivo data. We treat in silico granulomas with recommended daily doses of each FQ and compare efficacy by multiple metrics: bacterial load, sterilization rates, early bactericidal activity and efficacy under non-compliance and treatment interruption. GranSim reproduces in vivo plasma pharmacokinetics, spatial and temporal tissue pharmacokinetics and in vitro pharmacodynamics of these FQs. We predict that MXF kills intracellular bacteria more quickly than LVX and GFX due in part to a higher cellular accumulation ratio. We also show that all three FQs struggle to sterilize non-replicating bacteria residing in caseum. This is due to modest drug concentrations inside caseum and high inhibitory concentrations for this bacterial subpopulation. MXF and LVX have higher granuloma sterilization rates compared to GFX; and MXF performs better in a simulated non-compliance or treatment interruption scenario. We conclude that MXF has a small but potentially clinically significant advantage over LVX, as well as LVX over GFX. We illustrate how a systems pharmacology approach combining experimental and computational methods can guide antibiotic selection for TB.},

  abstract = {While active tuberculosis (TB) is a treatable disease, many complex factors prevent its global elimination. Part of the difficulty in developing optimal therapies is the large design space of antibiotic doses, regimens and combinations. Computational models that capture the spatial and temporal dynamics of antibiotics at the site of infection can aid in reducing the design space of costly and time-consuming animal pre-clinical and human clinical trials. The site of infection in TB is the granuloma, a collection of immune cells and bacteria that form in the lung, and new data suggest that penetration of drugs throughout granulomas is problematic. Here we integrate our computational model of granuloma formation and function with models for plasma pharmacokinetics, lung tissue pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for two first line anti-TB antibiotics. The integrated model is calibrated to animal data. We make four predictions. First, antibiotics are frequently below effective concentrations inside granulomas, leading to bacterial growth between doses and contributing to the long treatment periods required for TB. Second, antibiotic concentration gradients form within granulomas, with lower concentrations toward their centers. Third, during antibiotic treatment, bacterial subpopulations are similar for INH and RIF treatment: mostly intracellular with extracellular bacteria located in areas non-permissive for replication (hypoxic areas), presenting a slowly increasing target population over time. Finally, we find that on an individual granuloma basis, pre-treatment infection severity (including bacterial burden, host cell activation and host cell death) is predictive of treatment outcome.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Five complex network models were used with the IBM, namely, random, small world, scale-free, modular and hierarchical models. For every model, we applied the usual topological properties available in literature for the characterization of complex networks. Afterwards, we verified the topological effect of the contact networks in the evolution of tuberculosis and it was observed that different contact networks result in different epidemic thresholds \$\$(\textbackslash beta \^*)\$\$ for the spread of tuberculosis. More specifically, we noted that networks that have greater heterogeneity of connections need a lower \$\$\textbackslash beta \^*\$\$, however when the value of the infection rate \$\$(\textbackslash beta )\$\$ is large, the number of individuals infected are similar. It is believed that this observation may contribute to actions to reduce and eradicate the disease.},

We used a discrete event simulation model to predict the potential impact of HIV on increasing the probability and the expected severity of tuberculosis outbreaks. Our predictions reveal that an HIV epidemic can significantly increase the frequency and severity of tuberculosis outbreaks, but that this amplification effect of HIV on tuberculosis outbreaks is very sensitive to the tuberculosis treatment rate. At moderate or low treatment rates, even a moderate HIV epidemic can cause the average size of tuberculosis outbreaks to almost double in comparison with the expected outbreak size when HIV is absent. However, we determined that the amplification effect of HIV can be substantially reduced if the treatment rate of tuberculosis is very high. We discuss the significant implications of these results for the global control of tuberculosis. Our results also reveal that occasionally a "normal-virulence" strain of M. tuberculosis can be expected to generate a large outbreak. We discuss the implications of these results in understanding the virulence of M. tuberculosis and in the planned elimination of tuberculosis in the United States.},

  abstract = {The evolution of a tuberculosis (TB) infection toward active disease is driven by a combination of factors mostly related to the host response. The equilibrium between control of the bacillary load and the pathology generated is crucial as regards preventing the growth and proliferation of TB lesions. In addition, some experimental evidence suggests an important role of both local endogenous reinfection and the coalescence of neighboring lesions. Herein we propose a mathematical model that captures the essence of these factors by defining three hypotheses: (i) lesions grow logistically due to the inflammatory reaction; (ii) new lesions can appear as a result of extracellular bacilli or infected macrophages that escape from older lesions; and (iii) lesions can merge when they are close enough. This model was implemented in Matlab to simulate the dynamics of several lesions in a 3D space. It was also fitted to available microscopy data from infected C3HeB/FeJ mice, an animal model of active TB that reacts against Mycobacterium tuberculosis with an exaggerated inflammatory response. The results of the simulations show the dynamics observed experimentally, namely an initial increase in the number of lesions followed by fluctuations, and an exponential increase in the mean area of the lesions. In addition, further analysis of experimental and simulation results show a strong coincidence of the area distributions of lesions at day 21, thereby highlighting the consistency of the model. Three simulation series removing each one of the hypothesis corroborate their essential role in the dynamics observed. These results demonstrate that three local factors, namely an exaggerated inflammatory response, an endogenous reinfection, and a coalescence of lesions, are needed in order to progress toward active TB. The failure of one of these factors stops induction of the disease. This mathematical model may be used as a basis for developing strategies to stop the progression of infection toward disease in human lungs.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2016 Prats, Vilaplana, Valls, Marzo, Cardona and Lopez.},

We then used the model to project the future epidemic trajectory following the active screening interventions, as well as considering a counterfactual scenario with no intervention. We also simulated future scenarios including periodic interventions similar to those previously implemented, to assess their ability to reach the End TB Strategy targets and TB pre-elimination in the Marshall Islands.The screening activities conducted in 2017 and 2018 were estimated to have reduced TB incidence and mortality by around one-third in 2020, and are predicted to achieve the End TB Strategy milestone of 50\% incidence reduction by 2025 compared with 2015. Screening interventions had a considerably greater impact when latent TB screening and treatment were included, compared with active case finding alone. Such combined programmes implemented at the national level could achieve TB pre-elimination around 2040 if repeated every 2 years.Our model suggests that it would be possible to achieve TB pre-elimination by 2040 in the Marshall Islands through frequent repetition of the same interventions as those already implemented in the country. It also highlights the importance of including latent infection testing in active screening activities.},

  abstract = {Background: Tuberculosis (TB) control efforts are hampered by an imperfect understanding of TB epidemiology. The true age distribution of disease is unknown because a large proportion of individuals with active TB remain undetected. Understanding of transmission is limited by the asymptomatic nature of latent infection and the pathogen's capacity for late reactivation. A better understanding of TB epidemiology is critically needed to ensure effective use of existing and future control tools. Method(s): We use an agent-based model to simulate TB epidemiology in the five highest TB burden countries - India, Indonesia, China, the Philippines and Pakistan - providing unique insights into patterns of transmission and disease. Our model replicates demographically realistic populations, explicitly capturing social contacts between individuals based on local estimates of age-specific contact in household, school and workplace settings. Time-varying programmatic parameters are incorporated to account for the local history of TB control. Result(s): We estimate that the 15-19-year-old age group is involved in more than 20\% of transmission events in India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Pakistan, despite representing only 5\% of the local TB incidence. According to our model, childhood TB represents around one fifth of the incident TB cases in these four countries. In China, three quarters of incident TB were estimated to occur in the {$>$}= 45-year-old population. The calibrated per-contact transmission risk was found to be similar in each of the five countries despite their very different TB burdens. Conclusion(s): Adolescents and young adults are a major driver of TB in high-incidence settings. Relying only on the observed distribution of disease to understand the age profile of transmission is potentially misleading.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2019 The Author(s).}

  abstract = {Agent-based modeling is a new technique for understanding how the dynamics of biological, social, and other complex systems arise from the characteristics and behaviors of the agents making up these systems. This innovative textbook gives students and scientists the skills to design, implement, and analyze agent-based models. It starts with the fundamentals of modeling and provides an introduction to NetLogo, an easy-to-use, free, and powerful software platform. Nine chapters then each introduce an important modeling concept and show how to implement it using NetLogo. The book goes on to present strategies for finding the right level of model complexity and developing theory for agent behavior, and for analyzing and learning from models.   \emph{Agent-Based and Individual-Based Modeling}  features concise and accessible text, numerous examples, and exercises using small but scientific models. The emphasis throughout is on analysis--such as software testing, theory development, robustness analysis, and understanding full models--and on design issues like optimizing model structure and finding good parameter values. The first hands-on introduction to agent-based modeling, from conceptual design to computer implementation to parameterization and analysis Filled with examples and exercises, with updates and supplementary materials at http://www.railsback-grimm-abm-book.com Designed for students and researchers across the biological and social sciences Written by leading practitioners Leading universities that have adopted this book include: Amherst College Brigham Young University Carnegie Mellon University Miami University Northwestern University Old Dominion University Portland State University Rhodes College Susquehanna University University College, Dublin University of Arizona University of South Florida University of Virginia},

  abstract = {The eradication of bovine tuberculosis (bTB), caused by Mycobacterium bovis, from cattle in many locations worldwide is complicated by endemic foci of the disease in free-ranging wildlife. Recent simulation modeling of the bTB outbreak in white-tailed deer (WTD) in Michigan, USA, suggests current management is unlikely to eradicate bTB from the core outbreak area (DMU 452) within the next three decades. However, some level of control short of eradication might sufficiently reduce transmission from deer to cattle to a point at which the negative effects of bTB on the cattle industry could be reduced or eliminated, while minimizing the negative consequences of reducing deer numbers. We extended our existing spatially-explicit, individual-based stochastic simulation model of bTB transmission in WTD to incorporate transmission to cattle, to characterize the effects of vaccination and increased harvest of WTD on cattle herd breakdown rates, to examine the effects of localized culling or vaccination of WTD in the vicinity of cattle farms, to assess the effects of concurrent deer baiting, and to determine the effect of progressive restriction of deer/cattle contact on herd breakdowns. A spatially-explicit "cattle layer" was constructed describing the spatial locations, farm size and cattle density of all farms within and directly adjacent to DMU452. Increased hunter harvest or vaccination of deer, or a combination, would likely decrease the number of cattle herd breakdowns to {$<$}1 per year in less than 15 years. Concurrent deer baiting variably increased the time necessary to achieve zero breakdowns. The prevalence of bTB in deer needed to fall below \textasciitilde 0.5\% before {$<$}=1 herd breakdown per year could be expected, and below 0.1\% before zero breakdowns were likely. Locally applied post-harvest deer culling or vaccination also rapidly reduced herd breakdowns. On farm biosecurity measures needed to reduce deer to cattle contact by {$>$}95\% in order to reliably reduce herd breakdowns, and did not achieve zero breakdowns in the absence of other deer controls.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The modeled structure of enzyme was validated using Ramachandran plot and Sequence determination technique. A series of chlorosubstituted imidazole analogues were evaluated for Cytochrome P450 inhibitory activity using molecular docking studies. The imidazole analogues were prepared using Chem sketch and molecular docking was performed using Molergo Virtual Docker program.

Diagnosing of the infection involves chest X-ray. This is used by physicians to diagnose or monitor the disease. The diagnosing of the disease can be difficult as it is subjective for many reasons. Therefore computer systems are required to diagnose this disease with higher accuracy and help doctors.

  abstract = {Significance: A majority of therapeutic interventions occur late in the pathological process, when treatment outcome can be less predictable and effective, highlighting the need for new precise and preventive therapeutic development strategies that consider genomic and environmental context. Translational bioinformatics is well positioned to contribute to the many challenges inherent in bridging this gap between our current reactive methods of healthcare delivery and the intent of precision medicine, particularly in the areas of drug development, which forms the focus of this review. Recent Advances: A variety of powerful informatics methods for organizing and leveraging the vast wealth of available molecular measurements available for a broad range of disease contexts have recently emerged. These include methods for data driven disease classification, drug repositioning, identification of disease biomarkers, and the creation of disease network models, each with significant impacts on drug development approaches. Critical Issues: An important bottleneck in the application of bioinformatics methods in translational research is the lack of investigators who are versed in both biomedical domains and informatics. Efforts to nurture both sets of competencies within individuals and to increase interfield visibility will help to accelerate the adoption and increased application of bioinformatics in translational research. Future Directions: It is possible to construct predictive, multiscale network models of disease by integrating genotype, gene expression, clinical traits, and other multiscale measures using causal network inference methods. This can enable the identification of the "key drivers" of pathology, which may represent novel therapeutic targets or biomarker candidates that play a more direct role in the etiology of disease.

In conjunction with the two-country randomised Rapid Urine-based Screening for Tuberculosis to Reduce AIDS-related Mortality in Hospitalised Patients in Africa (STAMP) trial, we used a microsimulation model to estimate the effects on clinical outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of adding urine-based tuberculosis screening to sputum screening for hospitalised patients with HIV. Method(s): We compared two tuberculosis screening strategies used irrespective of symptoms among hospitalised patients with HIV in Malawi and South Africa: a GeneXpert assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance (Xpert) in sputum samples (standard of care) versus sputum Xpert combined with a lateral flow assay for M tuberculosis lipoarabinomannan in urine (Determine TB-LAM Ag test, Abbott, Waltham, MA, USA [formerly Alere]; TB-LAM) and concentrated urine Xpert (intervention). A cohort of simulated patients was modelled using selected characteristics of participants, tuberculosis diagnostic yields, and use of hospital resources in the STAMP trial. We calibrated 2-month model outputs to the STAMP trial results and projected clinical and economic outcomes at 2 years, 5 years, and over a lifetime. We judged the intervention to be cost-effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was less than US\$750/year of life saved (YLS) in Malawi and \$940/YLS in South Africa. A modified intervention of adding only TB-LAM to the standard of care was also evaluated. We did a budget impact analysis of countrywide implementation of the intervention. Finding(s): The intervention increased life expectancy by 0.5-1.2 years and was cost-effective, with an ICER of \$450/YLS in Malawi and \$840/YLS in South Africa. The ICERs decreased over time. At lifetime horizon, the intervention remained cost-effective under nearly all modelled assumptions. The modified intervention was at least as cost-effective as the intervention (ICERs \$420/YLS in Malawi and \$810/YLS in South Africa). Over 5 years, the intervention would save around 51 000 years of life in Malawi and around 171 000 years of life in South Africa. Health-care expenditure for screened individuals was estimated to increase by \$37 million (10.8\%) and \$261 million (2.8\%), respectively. Interpretation(s): Urine-based tuberculosis screening of all hospitalised patients with HIV could increase life expectancy and be cost-effective in resource-limited settings. Urine TB-LAM is especially attractive because of high incremental diagnostic yield and low additional cost compared with sputum Xpert, making a compelling case for expanding its use to all hospitalised patients with HIV in areas with high HIV burden and endemic tuberculosis.

At lifetime horizon, the intervention remained cost-effective under nearly all modelled assumptions. The modified intervention was at least as cost-effective as the intervention (ICERs \$420/YLS in Malawi and \$810/YLS in South Africa). Over 5 years, the intervention would save around 51 000 years of life in Malawi and around 171 000 years of life in South Africa. Health-care expenditure for screened individuals was estimated to increase by \$37 million (10.8\%) and \$261 million (2.8\%), respectively. Interpretation(s): Urine-based tuberculosis screening of all hospitalised patients with HIV could increase life expectancy and be cost-effective in resource-limited settings. Urine TB-LAM is especially attractive because of high incremental diagnostic yield and low additional cost compared with sputum Xpert, making a compelling case for expanding its use to all hospitalised patients with HIV in areas with high HIV burden and endemic tuberculosis.

  abstract = {Rationale: Shortened tuberculosis (TB) treatment regimens could improve outcomes by increasing adherence and reducing loss to follow-up (LTFU) and could decrease programmatic costs. Several clinical trials failed to show that four-month (4m) fluoroquinolone-containing regimens were non-inferior to standard six-month (6m) regimens. These trials differed in their composite clinical outcomes and their justification for their non-inferiority margin. Conclusions in each were driven entirely by increased relapses after the 4m regimen. There could still be a role for shortened regimens, however, in settings where LTFU during treatment is higher than that in clinical trials. Our objective was to project the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of 4m compared to 6m regimens for drug-susceptible TB in people with HIV (PWH) in South Africa. Method(s): We used a mathematical simulation model of TB and HIV to project clinical and economic outcomes of a 4m fluoroquinolone-containing regimen compared with a 6m conventional regimen for drug-susceptible pulmonary TB. PWH on or about to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) entered the model upon starting TB treatment. We used data from the OFLOTUB trial of shortened TB treatment, validating the model with trial outcomes at 30m and then projecting results at 60m. In the base case, trial-derived LTFU rates during TB treatment for the 4m and 6m regimens were 0.68\%/month and 0.85\%/month. Primary outcomes included mortality, life expectancy, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; cost-effectiveness threshold was South Africa's per capita GDP, US\$5,300). In sensitivity analysis, we increased monthly LTFU rates during treatment using data from observational cohorts. Result(s): In the base case, our model projected lower 30m mortality with the 4m regimen (11.0\%) versus the 6m regimen (11.5\%). The 4m regimen, compared with the 6m regimen, increased life expectancy (28.6m vs. 28.5m) and increased costs (\$2,200 vs. \$2,100). The ICERs at 30m and 60m were \$17,900/year-of-life saved (YLS) and \$5,800/YLS. As in the trial, TB relapses were more common with the 4m regimen, but all other unfavorable outcomes were less frequent. At 30m, the 4m regimen was cost-effective compared with the 6m regimen when LTFU rates during treatment were 2x and 4x those in the base case (ICER \$4,600/YLS and \$2,300/YLS, Table). Conclusion(s): Despite conferring a higher relapse rate, shortened TB treatment regimens may improve other important clinical outcomes in PWH, including survival, and may be cost-effective in South Africa, particularly if LTFU rates during treatment are higher than those in clinical trials (Table Presented).},

  abstract = {Rationale: Recent tuberculosis treatment trials failed to show that some 4-month (4m) regimens were noninferior to conventional 6-month (6m) regimens for a composite clinical outcome. Novel shortened regimens may still have important clinical and economic benefits in populations with high loss to follow-up (LTFU) and in subgroups such as people with human immunodeficiency virus. Objective(s): To identify scenarios in which a novel 4m regimen would be preferred to a conventional 6m regimen for treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis in people with human immunodeficiency virus in South Africa, in terms of short-term and long-term clinical and economic outcomes. Method(s): We used the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications-International microsimulation model to project outcomes modeled on participants in the OFLOTUB trial. For calibration purposes, we did a base case analysis by applying trialinformed parameters for the 4m/6m regimens, including monthly LTFU during treatment (0.68\%/0.83\%), average monthly tuberculosis recurrence (0.65\%/0.31\%), and monthly drug costs (U.S. dollars [USD]25.90/3.70). We then evaluated different scenarios and 4m regimen characteristics, varying key parameters, including LTFU (informed by observational cohort data), recurrence, and cost. We projected outcomes, including 2-year mortality and life expectancy. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis, evaluating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a 4m versus 6m regimen. Result(s): In the base case model analysis, risk of the composite unfavorable outcome in the 4m/6m groups was 19.8\%/15.9\%, similar to the trial; projected life expectancies were 22.1/22.3 years. In analyses of alternative scenarios and 4m regimen characteristics, a 4m regimen yielded lower risk of the composite unfavorable outcome than the conventional 6m regimen if LTFU increased to greater than 3.5\%/mo or if average recurrence after a 4m regimen decreased to less than 0.45\%/mo, and it yielded higher life expectancy if LTFU was greater than 3.5\%/mo or if recurrence was less than 0.5\%/mo. A 4m regimen was not cost-effective in the base case but became cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ,USD940/yr of life saved) in two-way sensitivity analysis; for example, if LTFU was greater than or equal to 5.3\%/mo and either average recurrence was less than or equal to 0.5\%/mo or drug cost was less than or equal to USD15/mo. Conclusion(s): A novel shortened tuberculosis treatment regimen could improve outcomes such as survival despite conferring a higher recurrence risk, particularly in settings where LTFU is higher than that seen in recent trials.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020 by the American Thoracic Society.},

  abstract = {The development of antibiotic resistance poses an increasing threat to global health. Understanding how resistance develops in bacteria is critical for the advancement of new strategies to combat antibiotic resistance. In the 1980s, it was discovered that certain antibiotics induce elevated rates of mutation in bacteria. From this, an "increased evolvability" hypothesis was proposed: antibiotic-induced mutagenesis increases the genetic diversity of bacterial populations, thereby increasing the rate at which bacteria develop antibiotic resistance. However, antibiotic-induced mutagenesis is one of multiple competing factors that act on bacterial populations exposed to antibiotics. Its relative importance in shaping evolutionary outcomes, including the development of antibiotic resistance, is likely to depend strongly on the conditions. Presently, there is no quantitative model that describes the relative contribution of antibiotic-induced mutagenesis to bacterial evolution. A far more complete understanding could be reached if we had access to technology that enabled us to study antibiotic-induced mutagenesis at the molecular-, cellular-, and population-levels simultaneously. Direct observations would, in principle, allow us to directly link molecular-level events with outcomes in individual cells and cell populations. In this review, we highlight microscopy studies which have allowed various aspects of antibiotic-induced mutagenesis to be directly visualized in individual cells for the first time. These studies have revealed new links between error-prone DNA polymerases and recombinational DNA repair, evidence of spatial regulation occurring during the SOS response, and enabled real-time readouts of mismatch and mutation rates. Further, we summarize the recent discovery of stochastic population fluctuations in cultures exposed to sub-inhibitory concentrations of bactericidal antibiotics and discuss the implications of this finding for the study of antibiotic-induced mutagenesis. The studies featured here demonstrate the potential of microscopy to provide direct observation of phenomena relevant to evolution under antibiotic-induced mutagenesis.\textcopyright{} Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020 Revitt-Mills and Robinson.},

  abstract = {Homoplasy is the occurrence of genotypes that are identical by state but not by descent. It arises through a number of means including convergent and reverse evolution, and horizontal gene transfer. When using molecular markers that are based on sequences possessing a finite number of character states, such as VNTR or spoligotypes, this is an unavoidable phenomenon. Here we discuss the extent of homoplasy and its impact on inferences drawn from spoligotypes and VNTR in epidemiological studies of tuberculosis. To further explore this problem, we developed a computer simulation model combining the processes of mutation and transmission. Our results show that while the extent of homoplasy is not negligible, its effect on the proportion of isolates clustered ("n - 1 method") is likely to be relatively low for spoligotyping. For VNTR-typing, homoplasy occurs at a low rate provided the number of loci used is high and the mutation rate is relatively high. However, deep phylogenetic inferences using spoligotypes or VNTRs with a small number of loci are likely to be unreliable. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {During transmission of seasonal endemic diseases such as measles and influenza, spatial waves of infection have been observed between large distant populations. Also, during the initial stages of an outbreak of a new or reemerging pathogen, disease incidence tends to occur in spatial clusters, which makes containment possible if you can predict the subsequent spread of disease. Spatial models are being used with increasing frequency to help characterize these large-scale patterns and to evaluate the impact of interventions. Here, I review several recent studies on four diseases that show the benefits of different methodologies: measles (patch models), foot-and-mouth disease (distance-transmission models), pandemic influenza (multigroup models), and smallpox (network models). This review highlights the importance of the household in spatial studies of human diseases, such as smallpox and influenza. It also demonstrates the need to develop a simple model of household demographics, so that these large-scale models can be extended to the investigation of long-time scale human pathogens, such as tuberculosis and HIV.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Although tuberculosis is treatable and preventable, approximately 200,000 children under 5 years of age die from the disease globally every year. The World Health Organization recommends tuberculosis screening for household contacts {$<$}5 years old and isoniazid prophylaxis for healthy exposed children. However, implementation fidelity has been poor in resource-constrained settings. METHOD(S): To quantify the "cost of inaction", we aimed to estimate the tuberculosis-related mortality and disability-adjusted life years in children associated with poor implementation of these guidelines in the 22 highest tuberculosis burden countries. In this statistical modelling study, we drew upon new estimates of child household contacts and co-prevalent disease cases in these countries. We used a simulation model to integrate multiple sources of data regarding natural history, treatment seeking and treatment efficacy and estimate the number of childhood cases and deaths from tuberculosis under conditions of contact tracing and isoniazid prophylaxis versus the standard of care. RESULT(S): We estimated that scaling up screening programs to reach 100\% of exposed children in high burden settings could prevent nearly 20,000 tuberculosis cases and 70,000 deaths each year, representing more than 30\% of global tuberculosis-related deaths in children under 5 years old. The majority of deaths averted were co-prevalent disease cases who were treated after detection by screening programs. CONCLUSION(S): Tuberculosis is currently amongst the top causes of global childhood mortality; full implementation of current WHO recommendations on screening of exposed children has the potential to prevent tens of thousands of pediatric deaths each year.

  abstract = {Intracellular pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis have evolved strategies for coping with the pressures encountered inside host cells. The ability to coordinate global gene expression in response to environmental and internal cues is one key to their success. Prolonged survival and replication within macrophages, a key virulence trait of M. tuberculosis, requires dynamic adaptation to diverse and changing conditions within its phagosomal niche. However, the physiological adaptations during the different phases of this infection process remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we have developed a multi-tiered approach to define the temporal patterns of gene expression in M. tuberculosis in a macrophage infection model that extends from infection, through intracellular adaptation, to the establishment of a productive infection. Using a clock plasmid to measure intracellular replication and death rates over a 14-day infection and electron microscopy to define bacterial integrity, we observed an initial period of rapid replication coupled with a high death rate. This was followed by period of slowed growth and enhanced intracellular survival, leading finally to an extended period of net growth. The transcriptional profiles of M. tuberculosis reflect these physiological transitions as the bacterium adapts to conditions within its host cell. Finally, analysis with a Transcriptional Regulatory Network model revealed linked genetic networks whereby M. tuberculosis coordinates global gene expression during intracellular survival. The integration of molecular and cellular biology together with transcriptional profiling and systems analysis offers unique insights into the host-driven responses of intracellular pathogens such as M. tuberculosis. \textcopyright{} 2012 Rohde et al.},

Therefore, it is important to assess what strategy is the most effective in identifying the onset of an epidemic and in minimizing the number of infected farms.The aim of the present work was to evaluate the performance of the bovine tuberculosis (bTB) surveillance system in the network of dairy farms in the Emilia-Romagna (ER) Region, Italy. A bTB-free Region since 2007, ER implements an integrated surveillance strategy based on three components, namely routine on-farm tuberculin skin-testing performed every 3 years, tuberculin skin-testing of cattle exchanged between farms, and post-mortem inspection at slaughterhouses. We assessed the effectiveness of surveillance by means of a stochastic network model of both within-farm and between-farm bTB dynamics calibrated on data available for ER dairy farms. Epidemic dynamics were simulated for five scenarios: the current ER surveillance system, a no surveillance scenario that we used as the benchmark to characterize epidemic dynamics, three additional scenarios in which one of the surveillance components was removed at a time so as to outline its significance in detecting the infection. For each scenario we ran Monte Carlo simulations of bTB epidemics following the random introduction of an infected individual in the network. System performances were assessed through the comparative analysis of a number of statistics, including the time required for epidemic detection and the total number of infected farms during the epidemic.Our analysis showed that slaughterhouse inspection is the most effective surveillance component in reducing the time for disease detection, while routine surveillance in reducing the number of multi-farms epidemics. On the other hand, testing exchanged cattle improved the performance of the surveillance system only marginally.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2015 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Infectious diseases in livestock can be transmitted through fomites: objects able to convey infectious agents. Between-farm spread of infections through fomites is mostly due to indirect contacts generated by on-farm visits of personnel that can carry pathogens on their clothes, equipment, or vehicles. However, data on farm visitors are often difficult to obtain because of the heterogeneity of their nature and privacy issues. Thus, models simulating disease spread between farms usually rely on strong assumptions about the contribution of indirect contacts on infection spread. By using data on veterinarian on-farm visits in a dairy farm system, we built a simple simulation model to assess the role of indirect contacts on epidemic dynamics compared to cattle movements (i.e. direct contacts). We showed that including in the simulation model only specific subsets of the information available on indirect contacts could lead to outputs widely different from those obtained with the full-information model. Then, we provided a simple preferential attachment algorithm based on the probability to observe consecutive on-farm visits from the same operator that allows overcoming the information gaps. Our results suggest the importance of detailed data and a deeper understanding of visit dynamics for the prevention and control of livestock diseases.},

  abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (bTB), caused by Mycobacterium bovis, is a chronic disease typical of cattle. Nonetheless, it can affect many mammals including humans, making it one of the most widespread zoonotic diseases worldwide. In industrialized countries, the main pathways of introduction of bTB into a herd are animal trade and contact with infected wildlife. In addition, for slow-spreading diseases with a long latent period such as bTB, shared seasonal pastures might be a between-herd transmission pathway, indeed farmers might unknowingly send infected animals to the pasture, since clinical signs are rarely evident in early infection. In this study, we developed a dynamic stochastic model to represent the spread of bTB in pastures. This was tailored to Canadian cow-calf herds, as we calibrated the model with data sourced from a recent bTB outbreak in Western Canada. We built a model for a herd with seasonal management, characterized by its partition into a group staying in the main facility and the remaining group(s) moving to summer pastures. We used this model to estimate the time of the first introduction of bTB into the herd. Furthermore, we expanded the model to include herds categorized as high-risk contacts with the index herd, in order to estimate the potential for disease spread on shared pastures. Finally, we explored two control scenarios to be applied to high-risk farms after the outbreak detection. Our results showed that the first introduction likely happened 3 to 5 years prior to the detection of the index herd, and the probability of bTB spreading in pastures was low, but not negligible. Nevertheless, the surveillance system currently in place was effective to detect potential outbreaks.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2018 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada Transboundary and Emerging Diseases \textcopyright{} 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

This explains the high priority that national health authorities and international organisations give to selecting control strategies for and the eradication of specific diseases. When a control strategy is selected and implemented, an effective method of evaluating its efficacy is through modelling. To illustrate the usefulness of models in evaluating control strategies, the authors describe several examples in detail, including three examples of classification and regression tree modelling to evaluate and improve the early detection of disease: West Nile fever in equids, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and multifactorial diseases, such as colony collapse disorder (CCD) in the United States. Also examined are regression modelling to evaluate skin test practices and the efficacy of an awareness campaign for bovine tuberculosis (bTB); mechanistic modelling to monitor the progress of a control strategy for BSE; and statistical nationwide modelling to analyse the spatio-temporal dynamics of bTB and search for potential risk factors that could be used to target surveillance measures more effectively. In the accurate application of models, an interdisciplinary rather than a multidisciplinary approach is required, with the fewest assumptions possible.},

  abstract = {Historically, dosing regimens for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) have been proposed in an empirical manner. Dose selection has often been the result of efficacy trials in which drugs were administered regardless of the magnitude of the effect of demographic factors on drug disposition. This has created challenges for the prescription of fixed-dose combinations with novel therapeutic agents. The objectives of this investigation were to evaluate the impact of body weight on the overall systemic exposure to pyrazinamide (PZA) and to assess whether the use of one fixed dose, without adjustment according to weight, would ensure target exposure and safety requirements across the overall patient population. Using a population pharmacokinetic model, simulation scenarios were explored based on population demographics from clinical trials in TB patients and on historical hepato-toxicity data. The systemic drug exposure (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC]), peak concentrations (the maximum concentration of drug in serum [Cmax]), the time above the MIC (t {$>$} MIC), and the risk of hepatotoxicity were evaluated for the current weight-banded regimen and compared to fixed doses under the assumption that pharmacokinetic differences are the primary drivers of toxicity. Evaluation of the standard weight banding reveals that more than 50\% of subjects in the weight range of 45 to 55 kg remain below the proposed target exposure to PZA. In contrast, the use of a fixed 1,500-mg dose resulted in a lower proportion of subjects under the target value, with a 0.2\% average overall increase in the risk of hepatotoxicity. Our results strongly support the use of a fixed-dose regimen for PZA in coformulation or combination with novel therapeutic agents. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

  abstract = {Animal tuberculosis (TB) is a multi-host zoonotic disease whose prevalence in cattle herds in Europe has been increasing, despite a huge investment in eradication. The composition of the host community is a fundamental driver of pathogen transmission, and yet this has not been formally quantified for animal TB in Europe. We quantified multi-host communities of animal TB, using stochastic models to estimate the number of infected domestic and wild hosts in three regions: officially TB-free Central-Western Europe, and two largely TB-endemic regions, the Iberian Peninsula and Britain and Ireland. We show that the estimated number of infected animals in the three regions was 290,059-1,605,612 and the numbers of infected non-bovine domestic and wild hosts always exceeded those of infected cattle, with ratios ranging from 3.3 (1.3-19.6):1 in Britain and Ireland to 84.3 (20.5-864):1 in the Iberian Peninsula. Our results illustrate for the first time the extent to which animal TB systems in some regions of Europe are dominated by non-bovine domestic and wild species.

  abstract = {The study evaluates the economic costs and benefits of improving tuberculosis control interventions in Thailand. Provider costs are determined on the basis of marginal treatment costs for varying case numbers and estimates of the cost of required infrastructure changes. Indirect costs are calculated as income lost due to morbidity and premature mortality. An epidemiological model is used to calculate case numbers and mortality under current control conditions and a scenario of improved control. An improved control strategy initially leads to a higher number of detected cases. For longer projection periods, the epidemiological impact of curing a higher proportion of infectious sources results in lower case numbers than those expected without programme improvement. Model simulations show a reduction of total annual case numbers through improved control measures by an average 45\% after a simulation period of 20 years. The corresponding societal savings in form of reduced indirect costs from the disease are U.S.\$ 2.4 billion. Reductions in direct provider costs can be expected as a result of decreased numbers of detected cases for longer evaluation periods, as well as a lower proportion of multi-drug-resistant cases. The mean value of predicted savings is U.S.\$ 8.3 million. Since this value is likely to be higher than the required investment in improved infrastructure, net savings can be expected. The result of an uncertainty analysis shows a wide range of potential additional costs or net savings with respect to direct provider costs. Indirect cost calculations show net savings for all parameter values.},

  abstract = {Purpose: ACTG A5164 demonstrated that early antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-infected patients with acute opportunistic infections (OIs) reduced death and AIDS progression compared to ART initiation 1 month later. We project the life expectancies, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of these strategies. Method(s): Using an HIV simulation model, we compared 2 strategies for patients with acute OIs: (1) an intervention to deliver early ART, and (2) deferred ART. Parameters from ACTG A5164 included initial mean CD4 count (47/muL), linkage to outpatient care (87\%), and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome 1 month after ART initiation (7\%). The estimated intervention cost was \$1,650/patient. Result(s): Early ART lowered projected 1-year mortality from 10.4\% to 8.2\% and increased life expectancy from 10.07 to 10.39 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Lifetime costs increased from \$385,220 with deferred ART to \$397,500 with early ART, primarily because life expectancy increased, producing an ICER of \$38,600/QALY. Results were most sensitive to increased intervention cost and decreased virologic efficacy in the early ART strategy. Conclusion(s): An intervention to initiate ART early in patients with acute OIs improves survival and meets US cost-effectiveness thresholds. Programs should be developed to implement this strategy at sites where HIV-infected patients present with OIs. \textcopyright{} 2010 Thomas Land Publishers, Inc.},

  abstract = {Background: Both CD4 count and viral load in HIV-infected persons are measured with error. There is no clear guidance on how to deal with this measurement error in the presence of missing data. Method(s): We used multiple overimputation, a method recently developed in the political sciences, to account for both measurement error and missing data in CD4 count and viral load measurements from four South African cohorts of a Southern African HIV cohort collaboration. Our knowledge about the measurement error of ln CD4 and log10 viral load is part of an imputation model that imputes both missing and mismeasured data. In an illustrative example, we estimate the association of CD4 count and viral load with the hazard of death among patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy by means of a Cox model. Simulation studies evaluate the extent to which multiple overimputation is able to reduce bias in survival analyses. Result(s): Multiple overimputation emphasizes more strongly the influence of having high baseline CD4 counts compared to both a complete case analysis and multiple imputation (hazard ratio for {$>$}200 cells/mm3 vs. {$<$}25 cells/mm3: 0.21 [95\% confidence interval: 0.18, 0.24] vs. 0.38 [0.29, 0.48], and 0.29 [0.25, 0.34], respectively). Similar results are obtained when varying assumptions about measurement error, when using p-splines, and when evaluating time-updated CD4 count in a longitudinal analysis. The estimates of the association with viral load are slightly more attenuated when using multiple imputation instead of multiple overimputation. Our simulation studies suggest that multiple overimputation is able to reduce bias and mean squared error in survival analyses. Conclusion(s): Multiple overimputation, which can be used with existing software, offers a convenient approach to account for both missing and mismeasured data in HIV research.},

  abstract = {Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a major world health problem. An estimated 2 billion people are presently infected and the disease causes approximately 3 million deaths per year. After bacteria are inhaled into the lung, a complex immune response is triggered leading to the formation of multicellular structures termed granulomas. It is believed that the collection of host granulomas either contain bacteria resulting in a latent infection or are unable to do so, leading to active disease. Thus, understanding granuloma formation and function is essential for improving both diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis. Granuloma formation is a complex spatio-temporal system involving interactions of bacteria, specific immune cells, including macrophages, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as immune effectors such as chemokine and cytokines. To study this complex dynamical system we have developed an agent-based model of granuloma formation in the lung. This model combines continuous representations of chemokines with discrete agent representations of macrophages and T cells in a cellular automata-like environment. Our results indicate that key host elements involved in granuloma formation are chemokine diffusion, prevention of macrophage overcrowding within the granuloma, arrival time, location and number of T cells within the granuloma, and an overall host ability to activate macrophages. Interestingly, a key bacterial factor is its intracellular growth rate, whereby slow growth actually facilitates survival. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background: Australia declared freedom from bovine tuberculosis (TB) in accordance with international guidelines in 1997 and has since maintained ongoing surveillance for this disease, primarily through abattoir surveillance of cattle carcases (meat inspection) for TB-like granulomas. The objectives of this study were to estimate the sensitivity of Australia's surveillance system and quantify the probability that Australia is free from bovine TB at the specified design prevalence. Method(s): The analysis included approximately 80 million records of individual cattle slaughtered and meat inspected at Australian abattoirs between 2005 and 2015 calendar years. Animals were identified and aggregated by property of birth within year. Herd- and population-level sensitivities and probability of freedom were estimated on an annual basis using a simulation model to account for uncertainty about the unit sensitivity of the meat inspection process. Result(s): The estimated median population sensitivity of Australia's TB surveillance system varied from a high of 80\%, in years when traditional meat inspection was used, to as low as 50\% after the introduction of visual-only meat inspection, for a design prevalence of 0.01\% (19 herds) of Australian breeding cattle herds and 0.5\% of animals within infected herds. The level of confidence in Australia's freedom from bovine TB was {$>$}95\% after the first year of the analysis and {$>$}99.5\% from 2007 through to the end of the analysis period in 2015. Reducing the animal-level or herd-level design prevalence, or the estimated sensitivity of meat inspection, reduced system sensitivity but confidence of disease freedom remained high. Conclusion(s): The results demonstrated a very high level of confidence that Australia's cattle herd is truly free from bovine TB. Meat inspection for granulomas in the head and thorax of slaughtered cattle underpins this result by providing surveillance data on an extremely large number of animals each year.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2017 Australian Veterinary Association},

The method avoids the requirement of satisfying the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, which is necessary in implementing the explicit version of the finite-difference method, but imposes an impractical bound on the time step. Instead, diffusion is modeled by a matrix-based, steady state approximate solution to the diffusion equation.

  abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis associated granuloma formation can be viewed as a structural immune response that can contain and halt the spread of the pathogen. In several mammalian hosts, including non-human primates, Mtb granulomas are often hypoxic, although this has not been observed in wild type murine infection models. While a presumed consequence, the structural contribution of the granuloma to oxygen limitation and the concomitant impact on Mtb metabolic viability and persistence remains to be fully explored. We develop a multiscale computational model to test to what extent in vivo Mtb granulomas become hypoxic, and investigate the effects of hypoxia on host immune response efficacy and mycobacterial persistence. Our study integrates a physiological model of oxygen dynamics in the extracellular space of alveolar tissue, an agent-based model of cellular immune response, and a systems biology-based model of Mtb metabolic dynamics. Our theoretical studies suggest that the dynamics of granuloma organization mediates oxygen availability and illustrates the immunological contribution of this structural host response to infection outcome. Furthermore, our integrated model demonstrates the link between structural immune response and mechanistic drivers influencing Mtbs adaptation to its changing microenvironment and the qualitative infection outcome scenarios of clearance, containment, dissemination, and a newly observed theoretical outcome of transient containment. We observed hypoxic regions in the containment granuloma similar in size to granulomas found in mammalian in vivo models of Mtb infection. In the case of the containment outcome, our model uniquely demonstrates that immune response mediated hypoxic conditions help foster the shift down of bacteria through two stages of adaptation similar to thein vitro non-replicating persistence (NRP) observed in the Wayne model of Mtb dormancy. The adaptation in part contributes to the ability of Mtb to remain dormant for years after initial infection.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2016 Sershen, Plimpton and May.},

  abstract = {Background: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide valuable information on the conformational changes that accompany time-dependent motions in proteins. The reported crystal structure of rat prestin (PDB 3LLO) is remarkable for an alpha1-alpha2 inter-helical angle that differs substantially from those observed in bacterial STAS domains of SulP anion transporters and anti-sigma factor antagonists. However, NMR data on the rat prestin STAS domain in solution suggests dynamic features at or near the alpha1-alpha2 helical region (Pasqualetto et al JMB, 2010). We therefore performed a 100 ns 300K MD simulation study comparing the STAS domains of rat prestin and (modeled) human pendrin, to explore possible conformational flexibility in the region of the alpha1 and alpha2 helices. Method(s): The conformation of the loop missing in the crystal structure of rat prestin STAS (11 amino acids between helix alpha1 and strand beta3) was built using Modeller. MD simulations were performed with GROMACSv4.6 using GROMOS96 53a6 all-atom force field. Result(s): A subset of secondary structured elements of the STAS domains exhibits significant conformational changes during the simulation time course. The conformationally perturbed segments include the majority of loop regions, as well as the alpha1 and alpha2 helices. A significant decrease in the alpha1-alpha2 inter-helical angle observed across the simulation trajectory leads to closer helical packing at their C-termini. The end-simulation conformations of the prestin and pendrin STAS domains, including their decreased alpha1-alpha2 inter-helical angles, resemble more closely the packing of corresponding helices in the STAS structures of bacterial SulP transporters Rv1739c and ychM, as well as those of the anti-sigma factor antagonists. Several structural segments of the modeled human pendrin STAS domain exhibit larger atomic motions and greater conformational deviations than the corresponding regions of rat prestin, predicting that the human pendrin STAS domain in solution structure may be more dynamic than rat prestin STAS. Regions of prestin and pendrin identified by RMS fluctuation data as exhibiting larger atomic fluctuations corresponded to nominal GDP-binding regions of the aligned Rv1739c STAS domain of M. tuberculosis. Conclusion(s): MD simulations of mammalian STAS domains reveal substantial predicted conformational heterogeneity. These predicted conformational dynamics serve to supplement the reported crystal structure of the rat prestin STAS domain, and extend our understanding of the roles of STAS domains in SLC26 anion transporter function. \textcopyright{} 2014 S.

OBJECTIVES: To characterize drivers of state-level heterogeneity in TB epidemiology in the four U.S. states that bear half the country's TB burden: California, Florida, New York, and Texas. METHODS: We constructed an individual-based model of TB in the four U.S. states and calibrated the model to state-specific demographic and age- and nativity-stratified TB incidence data. We used the model to infer differences in natural history of TB and in future projections of TB. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We found that differences in both demographic makeup (particularly the size and composition of the foreign-born population) and TB transmission dynamics contribute to state-level differences in TB epidemiology. The projected median annual rate of decline in TB incidence in the next decade was substantially higher in Texas (3.3\%; 95\% range, -5.6 to 10.9) than in California (1.7\%; 95\% range, -3.8 to 7.1), Florida (1.5\%; 95\% range, -7.4 to 14), and New York (1.9\%; 95\% range, -6.4 to 9.8). All scenarios projected a flattening of the decline in TB incidence by 2025 without additional resources or interventions. CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial state-level heterogeneity in TB epidemiology in the four states, which reflect both demographic factors and potential differences in the natural history of TB.

Some of the most promising candidate vaccines target adults, although high-coverage mass vaccinations may be logistically more challenging among this population than among children. Vaccine-delivery strategies that target high-risk groups or settings might yield proportionally greater impact than do those that target the general population. We developed an individual-based TB transmission model representing a hypothetical population consisting of people who worked in South African gold mines or lived in associated labor-sending communities. We simulated the implementation of a postinfection adult vaccine with 60\% efficacy and a mean effect duration of 10 years. We then compared the impact of a mine-targeted vaccination strategy, in which miners were vaccinated while in the mines, with that of a community-targeted strategy, in which random individuals within the labor-sending communities were vaccinated. Mine-targeted vaccination averted an estimated 0.37 TB cases per vaccine dose compared with 0.25 for community-targeted vaccination, for a relative efficacy of 1.46 (95\% range, 1.13\textendash 1.91). The added benefit of mine-targeted vaccination primarily reflected the disproportionate demographic burden of TB among the population of adult males as a whole. As novel vaccines for TB are developed, venue-based vaccine delivery that targets high-risk demographic groups may improve both vaccine feasibility and the impact on transmission.},

  abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (bTB), caused by Mycobacterium bovis, continues to be a serious economic problem for the British cattle industry. The Eurasian badger (Meles meles) is partly responsible for maintenance of the disease and its transmission to cattle. Previous attempts to manage the disease by culling badgers have been hampered by social perturbation, which in some situations is associated with increases in the cattle herd incidence of bTB. Following the licensing of an injectable vaccine, we consider the relative merits of management strategies to reduce bTB in badgers, and thereby reduce cattle herd incidence. We used an established simulation model of the badger-cattle-TB system and investigated four proposed strategies: business as usual with no badger management, large-scale proactive badger culling, badger vaccination, and culling with a ring of vaccination around it. For ease of comparison with empirical data, model treatments were applied over 150 km2 and were evaluated over the whole of a 300 km2 area, comprising the core treatment area and a ring of approximately 2 km. The effects of treatment were evaluated over a 10-year period comprising treatment for five years and the subsequent five year period without treatment. Against a background of existing disease control measures, where 144 cattle herd incidents might be expected over 10 years, badger culling prevented 26 cattle herd incidents while vaccination prevented 16. Culling in the core 150 km2 plus vaccination in a ring around it prevented about 40 cattle herd breakdowns by partly mitigating the negative effects of culling, although this approach clearly required greater effort. While model outcomes were robust to uncertainty in parameter estimates, the outcomes of culling were sensitive to low rates of land access for culling, low culling efficacy, and the early cessation of a culling strategy, all of which were likely to lead to an overall increase in cattle disease. \textcopyright{} 2012 Smith et al.},

A model optimizer produced a control program that required 2-month testing intervals (TI) with 2 negative whole-herd tests to leave quarantine. This control program minimized both farm and government costs. In all cases, test-and-removal costs were lower than depopulation costs, although the variability in costs increased for farms with high holding costs or small herd sizes. Increasing herd size significantly increased costs for both the farm and the government, while increasing indemnity payments significantly decreased farm costs and increasing testing costs significantly increased government costs. Based on the results of this model, we recommend 2-month testing intervals for herds after an outbreak of bovine tuberculosis, with 2 negative whole herd tests being sufficient to lift quarantine. A prolonged test and cull program may cause a state to lose its bTB-free status during the testing period. When the cost of losing the bTB-free status is greater than \$1.4 million then depopulation of farms could be preferred over a test and cull program. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

A stochastic model for bTB control in US cattle herds was adapted to more accurately represent cow-calf herd dynamics and was validated by comparison to 2 reported outbreaks. Control cost calculations were added to the model, which was then optimized to minimize costs for either the farm or the government. The results of the optimization showed that test-and-removal costs were minimized for both farms and the government if only 2 negative whole-herd tests were required to declare a herd free of infection, with a 2-3 month testing interval. However, the optimal testing interval for governments was increased to 2-4 months if the model was constrained to reject control programs leading to an infected herd being declared free of infection. Although farms always preferred test-and-removal to depopulation from a cost standpoint, government costs were lower with depopulation more than half the time in 2 of 8 regions. Global sensitivity analysis showed that indemnity costs were significantly associated with a rise in the cost to the government, and that low replacement rates were responsible for the long time to detection predicted by the model, but that improving the sensitivity of slaughterhouse screening and the probability that a slaughtered animal's herd of origin can be identified would result in faster detection times.

The human vaccine BCG has been used for the control of bovine tuberculosis in badgers since 2010 and is expected to increase. Understanding the long-term effects of repeated vaccination campaigns on disease prevalence is vital, but modelling thus far has generally assumed that a vaccine provides perfect protection to a proportion of the population, and that animals exposed to a repeated vaccination have a second independent chance of becoming protected. We held a workshop with experts in the field to obtain consensus over the main pathways for partial protection in the badger, and then simulated these using an established model. The available data supported the possibility that some individuals receive no benefit from the BCG vaccine, others may result in a delayed disease progression and in the remaining animals, vaccine protected the individual from any onward transmission. Simulating these pathways using different levels of overall efficacy demonstrated that partial protection leads to a reduced effect of vaccination, but in all of the identified scenarios it was still possible to eradicate disease in an isolated population with no disease introduction. We also identify those potential vaccination failures that require further investigation to determine which of our proposed pathways is the more likely.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2022},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several diseases, many of which nowadays pandemic, consist of multifactorial pathologies. Paradigmatic examples come from the immune response to pathogens, in which cases the effects of different infections combine together, yielding complex mutual feedback, often a positive one that boosts infection progression in a scenario that can easily become lethal. HIV is one such infection, which weakens the immune system favouring the insurgence of opportunistic infections, amongst which Tuberculosis (TB). The treatment with antiretroviral therapies has shown effective in reducing mortality. An in-depth understanding of complex systems, like the one consisting of HIV, TB and related therapies, is an open great challenge, on the boundaries of bioinformatics, computational and systems biology. RESULT(S): We present a simplified formalisation of the highly dynamic system consisting of HIV, TB and related therapies, at the cellular level. The progression of the disease (AIDS) depends hence on interactions between viruses, cells, chemokines, the high mutation rate of viruses, the immune response of individuals and the interaction between drugs and infection dynamics. We first discuss a deterministic model of dual infection (HIV and TB) which is able to capture the long-term dynamics of CD4 T cells, viruses and Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF). We contrast this model with a stochastic approach which captures intrinsic fluctuations of the biological processes. Furthermore, we also integrate automated reasoning techniques, i.e. probabilistic model checking, in our formal analysis. Beyond numerical simulations, model checking allows general properties (effectiveness of anti-HIV therapies) to be verified against the models by means of an automated procedure. Our work stresses the growing importance and flexibility of model checking techniques in bioinformatics. In this paper we i) describe HIV as a complex case of infectious diseases; ii) provide a number of different formal descriptions that suitably account for aspects of interests; iii) suggest that the integration of different models together with automated reasoning techniques can improve the understanding of infections and therapies through formal analysis methodologies. CONCLUSION(S): We argue that the described methodology suitably supports the study of viral infections in a formal, automated and expressive manner. We envisage a long-term contribution of this kind of approaches to clinical Bioinformatics and Translational Medicine.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant public health challenge, motivated by the diversity of healthcare epidemiological settings, as other factors. Cost-effective screening has substantial importance for TB control, demanding new diagnostic tools. This paper proposes a decision support tool (DST) for screening pulmonary TB (PTB) patients at a secondary clinic. The DST is composed of an adaptive resonance model (iART) for risk group identification (low, medium and high) and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network for classifying patients as active or inactive PTB. Our tool attains an overall sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) of 92\% (95\% CI; 79-97) and 58\% (95\% CI; 47-68), respectively. SE values for smear-positive and smear-negative patients are 96\% (95\% CI; 80-99) and 82\% (95\% CI; 52-95), as well as higher than 83\% (95\% CI; 43-97) in low and high-risk cases. Even in scenarios with prevalence up to 20\%, negative predictive values superior to 95\% are obtained. The proposed DST provides a quick and low-cost pretest for presumptive PTB patients, which is useful to guide confirmatory testing and patient management, especially in settings with limited resources in low and middle-incoming countries.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

However, the TB burden among children is relatively unknown in Kenya where two-thirds of estimated TB cases are undiagnosed annually. Very few studies have used Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), hybrid ARIMA, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) models to model infectious diseases globally. We applied ARIMA, hybrid ARIMA, and Artificial Neural Network models to predict and forecast TB incidences among children in Homa bay and Turkana Counties in Kenya. Methods The ARIMA, ANN, and hybrid models were used to predict and forecast monthly TB cases reported in the Treatment Information from Basic Unit (TIBU) system for Homa bay and Turkana Counties between 2012 and 2021. The data were split into training data, for model development, and testing data, for model validation using an 80:20 split ratio respectively. Results The hybrid ARIMA model (ARIMA-ANN) produced better predictive and forecast accuracy compared to the ARIMA (0,0,1,1,0,1,12) and NNAR (1,1,2) [12] models. Furthermore, using the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test, the predictive accuracy of NNAR (1,1,2) [12] versus ARIMA-ANN, and ARIMA-ANN versus ARIMA (0,0,1,1,0,1,12) models were significantly different, p{$<$}0.001, respectively. The 12-month forecasts showed a TB prevalence of 175 to 198 cases per 100,000 children in Homa bay and Turkana Counties in 2022. Conclusion The hybrid (ARIMA-ANN) model produces better predictive and forecast accuracy compared to the single ARIMA and ANN models.

  abstract = {Background The sites of mycobacterial infection in the lungs of tuberculosis (TB) patients have complex structures and poor vascularization, which obstructs drug distribution to these hard-to-reach and hard-to-treat disease sites, further leading to suboptimal drug concentrations, resulting in compromised TB treatment response and resistance development. Quantifying lesion-specific drug uptake and pharmacokinetics (PKs) in TB patients is necessary to optimize treatment regimens at all infection sites, to identify patients at risk, to improve existing regimens, and to advance development of novel regimens. Using drug-level data in plasma and from 9 distinct pulmonary lesion types (vascular, avascular, and mixed) obtained from 15 hard-to-treat TB patients who failed TB treatments and therefore underwent lung resection surgery, we quantified the distribution and the penetration of 7 major TB drugs at these sites, and we provide novel tools for treatment optimization. Methods and findings A total of 329 plasma- and 1,362 tissue-specific drug concentrations from 9 distinct lung lesion types were obtained according to optimal PK sampling schema from 15 patients (10 men, 5 women, aged 23 to 58) undergoing lung resection surgery (clinical study NCT00816426 performed in South Korea between 9 June 2010 and 24 June 2014). Seven major TB drugs (rifampin [RIF], isoniazid [INH], linezolid [LZD], moxifloxacin [MFX], clofazimine [CFZ], pyrazinamide [PZA], and kanamycin [KAN]) were quantified. We developed and evaluated a site-of-action mechanistic PK model using nonlinear mixed effects methodology. We quantified population- and patient-specific lesion/plasma ratios (RPLs), dynamics, and variability of drug uptake into each lesion for each drug. CFZ and MFX had higher drug exposures in lesions compared to plasma (median RPL 2.37, range across lesions 1.26-22.03); RIF, PZA, and LZD showed moderate yet suboptimal lesion penetration (median RPL 0.61, range 0.21-2.4), while INH and KAN showed poor tissue penetration (median RPL 0.4, range 0.03-0.73). Stochastic PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) simulations were carried out to evaluate current regimen combinations and dosing guidelines in distinct patient strata. Patients receiving standard doses of RIF and INH, who are of the lower range of exposure distribution, spent substantial periods ({$>$}12 h/d) below effective concentrations in hard-to-treat lesions, such as caseous lesions and cavities. Standard doses of INH (300 mg) and KAN (1,000 mg) did not reach therapeutic thresholds in most lesions for a majority of the population. Drugs and doses that did reach target exposure in most subjects include 400 mg MFX and 100 mg CFZ. Patients with cavitary lesions, irrespective of drug choice, have an increased likelihood of subtherapeutic concentrations, leading to a higher risk of resistance acquisition while on treatment. A limitation of this study was the small sample size of 15 patients, performed in a unique study population of TB patients who failed treatment and underwent lung resection surgery. These results still need further exploration and validation in larger and more diverse cohorts.Copyright \textcopyright{} This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

  abstract = {Background: Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) is a major health challenge in India that is gaining increasing public attention, but the implications of India's evolving MDR TB epidemic are poorly understood. As India's MDR TB epidemic is transitioning from a treatment-generated to transmission-generated epidemic, we sought to evaluate the potential effectiveness of the following two disease control strategies on reducing the prevalence of MDR TB: a) improving treatment of non-MDR TB; b) shortening the infectious period between the activation of MDR TB and initiation of effective MDR treatment. Methods and Findings:We developed a dynamic transmission microsimulation model of TB in India. The model followed individuals by age, sex, TB status, drug resistance status, and treatment status and was calibrated to Indian demographic and epidemiologic TB time trends. The main effectiveness measure was reduction in the average prevalence reduction of MDR TB over the ten years after control strategy implementation. We find that improving non-MDR cure rates to avoid generating new MDR cases will provide substantial non-MDR TB benefits but will become less effective in reducing MDR TB prevalence over time because more cases will occur from direct transmission by 2015, the model estimates 42\% of new MDR cases are transmission-generated and this proportion continues to rise over time, assuming equal transmissibility of MDR and drug-susceptible TB. Strategies that disrupt MDR transmission by shortening the time between MDR activation and treatment are projected to provide greater reductions in MDR prevalence compared with improving non-MDR treatment quality: implementing MDR diagnostic improvements in 2017 is expected to reduce MDR prevalence by 39\%, compared with 11\% reduction from improving non-MDR treatment quality. Conclusion(s): As transmission-generated MDR TB becomes a larger driver of the MDR TB epidemic in India, rapid and accurate MDR TB diagnosis and treatment will become increasingly effective in reducing MDR TB cases compared to non-MDR TB treatment improvements. \textcopyright{} 2014 Suen et al.}

  abstract = {In this paper we use mathematical modelling to consider the broad advantages and disadvantages of fertility control over lethal control for bovine tuberculosis in badger populations. We use a deliberately simple model, attempting to capture only the key transmission processes. The model is parametrized with reference to the long-term Woodchester Park study. Estimates of mortality rate from this study suggest no significant extra mortality risk for animals with evidence of infection as indicated by the presence of anti-Mycobacterium bovis antibodies or M. bovis isolation. We find that large reductions in prevalence are sometimes the consequence of only moderate reductions in population numbers. If we assume that the act of control does not in itself affect transmission rates, then as far as eradication is concerned, both fertility control and mortality control operate through the same epidemiological mechanism, the removal of susceptibles: if one is in principle capable of keeping a population low enough to be infection free then so is the other. It is necessary to continue either form of control at regular intervals to maintain a constant level of infection in the long term. If control were to be stopped, return to precontrol levels of badger population and infection prevalence would be expected within a few years. Fertility control is less effective in reducing population density than lethal control since it can only act, at maximum, to remove one age cohort per year. It is also less effective in reducing transmission as it can only ever remove susceptibles, while lethal control also removes infectious badgers. However, if the social disturbance caused by lethal control does in fact increase contact rates for the remaining infectious badgers, the relative efficacies of the two strategies become a great deal less clear. While we have no quantitative data on the extent to which social perturbation does act to promote transmission, model simulations show that it is possible to develop plausible scenarios in which the lethal control may actually act to increase the absolute numbers of animals infected, while reducing the number of uninfected animals to very low numbers.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis can be studied at the population level by genotyping strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from patients. We use an approximate Bayesian computational method in combination with a stochastic model of tuberculosis transmission and mutation of a molecular marker to estimate the net transmission rate, the doubling time, and the reproductive value of the pathogen. This method is applied to a published data set from San Francisco of tuberculosis genotypes based on the marker IS6110. The mutation rate of this marker has previously been studied, and we use those estimates to form a prior distribution of mutation rates in the inference procedure. The posterior point estimates of the key parameters of interest for these data are as follows: net transmission rate, 0.69/year [95\% credibility interval (C.I.) 0.38, 1.08]; doubling time, 1.08 years (95\% C.I. 0.64, 1.82); and reproductive value 3.4 (95\% C.I. 1.4, 79.7). These figures suggest a rapidly spreading epidemic, consistent with observations of the resurgence of tuberculosis in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s.

Integrated with certain sampling schemes, such mechanistic models can be applied to analyse public health surveillance data, such as assessing the effectiveness of preventive measures (e.g. social distancing and quarantine) and forecasting disease spread patterns. This review begins with a nationwide macromechanistic model and related statistical analyses, including model specification, estimation, inference and prediction. Then, it presents a community-level micromodel that enables high-resolution analyses of regional surveillance data to provide current and future risk information useful for local government and residents to make decisions on reopenings of local business and personal travels. r software and scripts are provided whenever appropriate to illustrate the numerical detail of algorithms and calculations. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic surveillance data from the state of Michigan are used for the illustration throughout this paper.},

We begin with presenting a HIV-TB co-infection model and analyze both HIV and TB sub-models separately. The basic reproduction numbers corresponding to HIV-only, TB-only and the HIV-TB full model are computed. The disease-free equilibrium point of the HIV sub-model is shown to be locally as well as globally asymptotically stable when its corresponding reproduction number is less than unity. The HIV-only model exhibits a transcritical bifurcation. On the other hand, for the TB sub-model, the disease-free equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable but may not be globally asymptotically stable. We have also analyzed the full HIV-TB co-infection model. Numerical simulations are performed to investigate the effect of treatment rate in the presence of resource limitation for TB infected individuals, which emphasize the fact that to reduce co-infection from the population programs to accelerate the treatment of TB should be implemented.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE Testing for and treating latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is among the main strategies to achieve TB elimination in the United States. The best approach to testing among non-US born residents, particularly those with comorbid conditions, is uncertain. OBJECTIVE To estimate health outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of LTBI testing and treatment among non-US born residents with and without medical comorbidities. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Decision analytic tree and Markov cohort simulation model among non-US born residents with no comorbidities, with diabetes, with HIV infection, or with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) using a health care sector perspective with 3\% annual discounting. Strategies compared included no testing, tuberculin skin test (TST), interferon gamma release assay (IGRA), confirm positive (initial TST, IGRA only for TST-positive results; both tests positive indicates LTBI), and confirm negative (initial IGRA, then TST for IGRA-negative; any test positive indicates LTBI). All strategies were coupled to treatment with 3 months of self-administered rifapentine and isoniazid. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Number needed to test and treat to prevent 1 case of TB reactivation, discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), discounted lifetime medical costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS Improving health outcomes increased costs, with choice of test dependent on willingness to pay. Strategies ranked by ascending costs and benefits: no testing, confirm positive, TST, IGRA, and confirm negative. The ICERs varied by non-US born patient risk group: patients with no comorbidities, IGRA was likely cost-effective at \$83 000/QALY; patients with diabetes, both confirm positive (\$53 000/QALY) and IGRA (\$120 000/QALY) were likely cost-effective; patients with HIV, confirm negative was clearly preferred (\$63 000/QALY); and patients with ESRD, no testing was cost-effective. Increased LTBI prevalence and reduced return for TST reading improved IGRA's relative performance. In 10 000 probabilistic simulations among non-US born patients with no comorbidities, with diabetes, and with HIV, some form of testing was virtually always cost-effective. These simulations highlight the uncertainty of test choice for non-US born patients with no comorbidities and non-US born patients with diabetes, but strategies including IGRA were preferred in over 60\% of simulations for all non-US born populations except those with ESRD. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Testing for and treating LTBI among non-US born residents with and without selected comorbidities is likely cost-effective except among those with ESRD in whom competing risks of death limit benefits. Strategies including IGRA fell below a \$100 000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold for non-US born patients with no comorbidities, patients with diabetes, and patients with HIV.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2017 American Medical Association.

  abstract = {SETTING: Molecular epidemiology suggests that most Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission in high-burden settings occurs outside the home. OBJECTIVE(S): To estimate the risk of M. tuberculosis transmission inside public buildings in a high TB burden community in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. DESIGN: Carbon dioxide (CO2) sensors were placed inside eight public buildings. Measurements were used with observations of occupancy to estimate infection risk using an adaptation of the Wells-Riley equation. Ventilation modelling using CONTAM was used to examine the impact of low-cost retrofits on transmission in a health clinic. RESULT(S): Measurements indicate that infection risk in the church, classroom and clinic waiting room would be high with typical ventilation, occupancy levels and visit durations. For example, we estimated that health care workers in a clinic waiting room had a 16.9-24.5\% annual risk of M. tuberculosis infection. Modelling results indicate that the simple addition of two new windows allowing for cross-ventilation, at a cost of US\$330, would reduce the annual risk to health care workers by 57\%. CONCLUSION(S): Results indicate that public buildings in this community have a range of ventilation and occupancy characteristics that may influence transmission risks. Simple retrofits may result in dramatic reductions in M. tuberculosis transmission, and intervention studies should therefore be considered.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2016 Taylor et al.},

  abstract = {While a number of studies have considered the dynamics of ambient or environmental particles in the respiratory tract, far fewer have evaluated the transport and deposition of pharmaceutical aerosols from inhalers in the mouth-throat (MT) and tracheobronchial (TB) airways. The objective of this study was to develop a new stochastic individual path (SIP) modeling approach for simulating the MT and TB deposition of a pharmaceutical aerosol from a dry powder inhaler and to evaluate the effects of transient vs. steady state conditions and sampling of the airways. In the SIP approach, representative models of the MT and upper TB geometries are considered through the third respiratory bifurcation (B3; approximately lobar bronchi). Stochastic individual paths are then evaluated extending from B4 to the terminal bronchioles (B15) in which one branch of each bifurcation is continued and one is not. Three SIP geometries were considered extending into the lower right lung lobe through the end of the conducting airways. A commonly prescribed dry powder inhaler (DPI) was connected to the MT geometry and the deposition of drug mass from a realistic polydisperse pharmaceutical aerosol was evaluated. Predictions of deposited drug mass in the MT and upper TB geometries were found to be in good agreement with concurrent experimental results. Transient inhalation was shown to influence the deposition of particles in the MT and upper TB airways through B3, where the Womersley number is greater than 1. In contrast, transient conditions were found to have little influence on deposition in the TB region starting with B4, where steady state simulations provided a good representation of total, regional, bifurcation-averaged, and localized deposition. Furthermore, a single SIP model was shown to characterize both regional and highly localized deposition within a lung lobe assuming mean airway dimensions. The resulting SIP model provides a highly efficient method to simulate the regional and local deposition of pharmaceutical aerosols throughout the conducting airways. In comparison with performing fully transient simulations of all branches in the regions considered, the SIP modeling approach reduces computational effort by a factor of approximately 3x105 while predicting regional and local deposition values to within approximately 5\%. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Method(s): We estimated the numbers of PC diagnosed, PC deaths averted, and biopsy procedures performed with early diagnosis in a simulated population of men beginning at age 50 using a microsimulation model. The model simulates the natural history of PC and the impact of early diagnosis using epidemiological data from a systematic review of literature. Early diagnosis started at age 55 years, with a PSA threshold of 4 ng/mL. The strategies included (S1) SB alone, (S2) SB combined with mpMRI-targeted biopsy (SB/mpMRI-TB), and (S3) SB/mpMRI-TB following selection of patients based on positive mpMRI (PIRAD3-5) or PSA density (PSAd) {$<$} 0.15. A sensitivity of 0.92 and specificity of 0.48 for detecting ISUP grade {$>$}= 2 PC was used for mpMRI. Result(s): Compared to no early diagnosis, early diagnosis with SB alone (S1) was estimated to avoid 647 PC-related deaths per 100,000 men over their lifetimes. Using mpMRI was estimated to result in an additional 126 and 118 fewer deaths per 100,000 if mpMRI was used in conjunction with SB (S2) or with SB following patient selection for biopsy by mpMRI or PSAd (S3). To avoid a PCrelated death was estimated to require screening of 145 men with SB alone, 121 with SB/mpMRI-TB, and 122 with mpMRI or PSAd followed by SB/mpMRI-TB. Adding mpMRI to SB was also found to reduce the predicted number of biopsies performed (21,821 for SB alone versus 16,510 for SB/mpMRI-TB and 15,385 for SB/mpMRI-TB following selection with mpMRI or PSAd). Conclusion(s): The results indicate that using mpMRI as a detection method will improve the effectiveness of early diagnosis. Compared to SB alone, using mpMRI through the SB/mpMRI-TB approach, with or without prior patient selection based on mpMRI or PSAd assessments, would result in a reduction in PC-related mortality and in the number of biopsies performed.

Specifically, in clinical trials of vaccine efficacy, a readout of protection against TB disease can be mapped to multiple dynamical mechanisms, an issue that has been overlooked so far. Here, we describe this limitation and its effect on model-based evaluations of vaccine impact. Furthermore, we propose a methodology to analyze efficacy trials that circumvents it, leveraging a combination of compartmental models and stochastic simulations. Using our approach, we can disentangle the different possible mechanisms of action underlying vaccine protection effects against TB, conditioned to trial design, size, and duration. Our results unlock a deeper interpretation of the data emanating from efficacy trials of TB vaccines, which renders them more interpretable in terms of transmission models and translates into explicit recommendations for vaccine developers.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2019, The Author(s).},

The authors made a model representing tuberculosis trends as influenced by different variants of control measures in the Czech Socialist Republic. The year 1949 was chosen as the initial year for this simulation model of the epidemiology of tuberculosis - in that year the first campaign of mass BCG vaccination was accomplished throughout the country The authors used Azuma's simulation model from Japan as the basis for the mathematical procedure and modified different parts of the model in order to achieve concordance with the conditions in Czechoslovakia. The authors are aware of the fact that the validity of conclusions resulting from this model is limited by assumptions used and quality of the data put into the mathematical model. For example, the data on distribution of epidemiological groups according to sex and age or those on average period elapsed from the beginning of disease symptoms to the beginning of tuberculosis treatment, collected from the whole Czech Socialist Republic, are not yet available. If such data could be added to the model in the future, the validity of its results might increase. The establishment of a Central Tuberculosis Register in the country will enable this information to be obtained. The authors therefore conclude that the simulation model appears to be a suitable means for measuring the impact which different control policies may make by causing changes in tuberculosis trends.},

  abstract = {Background: The patterns of relative species abundance are commonly studied in ecology and epidemiology to provide insights into underlying dynamical processes. Molecular types (MVLA-types) of Mycobacterium bovis, the causal agent of bovine tuberculosis, are now routinely recorded in culture-confirmed bovine tuberculosis cases in Northern Ireland. In this study, we use ecological approaches and simulation modelling to investigate the distribution of relative abundances of MVLA-types and its potential drivers. We explore four biologically plausible hypotheses regarding the processes driving molecular type relative abundances: sampling and speciation; structuring of the pathogen population; historical changes in population size; and transmission heterogeneity (superspreading). Result(s): Northern Irish herd-level MVLA-type surveillance shows a right-skewed distribution of MVLA-types, with a small number of types present at very high frequencies and the majority of types very rare. We demonstrate that this skew is too extreme to be accounted for by simple neutral ecological processes. Simulation results indicate that the process of MVLA-type speciation and the manner in which the MVLA-typing loci were chosen in Northern Ireland cannot account for the observed skew. Similarly, we find that pathogen population structure, assuming for example a reservoir of infection in a separate host, would drive the relative abundance distribution in the opposite direction to that observed, generating more even abundances of molecular types. However, we find that historical increases in bovine tuberculosis prevalence and/or transmission heterogeneity (superspreading) are both capable of generating the skewed MVLA-type distribution, consistent with findings of previous work examining the distribution of molecular types in human tuberculosis. Conclusion(s): Although the distribution of MVLA-type abundances does not fit classical neutral predictions, our simulations show that increases in pathogen population size and/or superspreading are consistent with the pattern observed, even in the absence of selective pressures acting on the system.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2017 The Author(s).},

For years Czechoslovakia has been taking part in the international research of methods of tuberculosis control; in compliance with the results of these studies, its programme of tuberculosis control is being modified. Decision processes are more difficult when measures till now applied should be limited or given up. In such cases it is necessary to evaluate not only the efficiency of defined health measures but also their possibilities of application, acceptability and influence on the tuberculosis situation in all. For the choice of appropriate models of tuberculosis control, the application of experience from other countries should be regarded. However, sometimes it is not possible to use this experience in the own country because there are obvious differences in other conditions. Mathematical simulation models may be of good help in the decision process answering the purpose of discerning the effect of different variants of the control measure on the epidemiological trends. For this purpose reliable statistic data should be available. To get such information, a central tuberculosis register was established in CSR gathering data on new cases of tuberculosis, on relapses, on the further development of the cases of tuberculosis registered and on data concerning the quality of case-finding, diagnostics and therapy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Canada, active tuberculosis (TB) disease rates remain disproportionately higher among the Indigenous population, especially among the Inuit in the north. We used mathematical modeling to evaluate how interventions might enhance existing TB control efforts in a region of Nunavut. METHODS: We developed a stochastic, agent-based model of TB transmission that captured the unique household and community structure. Evaluated interventions included: (i) rapid treatment of active cases; (ii) rapid contact tracing; (iii) expanded screening programs for latent TB infection (LTBI); and (iv) reduced household density. The outcomes of interest were incident TB infections and total diagnosed active TB disease over a 10- year time period. RESULTS: Model-projected incidence in the absence of additional interventions was highly variable (range: 33-369 cases) over 10 years. Compared to the 'no additional intervention' scenario, reducing the time between onset of active TB disease and initiation of treatment reduced both the number of new TB infections (47\% reduction, relative risk of TB = 0.53) and diagnoses of active TB disease (19\% reduction, relative risk of TB = 0.81). Expanding general population screening was also projected to reduce the burden of TB, although these findings were sensitive to assumptions around the relative amount of transmission occurring outside of households. Other potential interventions examined in the model (school-based screening, rapid contact tracing, and reduced household density) were found to have limited effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: In a region of northern Canada experiencing a significant TB burden, more rapid treatment initiation in active TB cases was the most impactful intervention evaluated. Mathematical modeling can provide guidance for allocation of limited resources in a way that minimizes disease transmission and protects population health.},

  abstract = {The problem of magnetic transitions between the low-temperature (macrospin ordered) phases in two-dimensional XY arrays is addressed. The system is modelled as a plane structure of identical single-domain particles arranged in a square lattice and coupled by the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction; all the particles possess a strong easy-plane magnetic anisotropy. The basic state of the system in the considered temperature range is an antiferromagnetic (AF) stripe structure, where the macrospins (particle magnetic moments) are still involved in thermofluctuational motion: the superparamagnetic blocking Tb temperature is lower than that (Taf) of the AF transition. The description is based on the stochastic equations governing the dynamics of individual magnetic moments, where the interparticle interaction is added in the mean-field approximation. With the technique of a generalized Ott-Antonsen theory, the dynamics equations for the order parameters (including the macroscopic magnetization and the AF order parameter) and the partition function of the system are rigorously obtained and analysed. We show that inside the temperature interval of existence of the AF phase, a static external field tilted to the plane of the array is able to induce first-order phase transitions from AF to ferromagnetic state; the phase diagrams displaying stable and metastable regions of the system are presented.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Foreign-born persons in Canada contribute 67\% of all tuberculosis (TB) cases annually, but represent only 21\% of the total population. Molecular epidemiological studies suggest that most foreign-born TB cases result from the reactivation of latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) acquired before immigration. OBJECTIVE : To estimate the effect on incidence of a prevention strategy that would screen selected immigrants at arrival for LTBI and offer preventive treatment to those who test positive. DESIGN: A deterministic model was developed to quantify the incidence of active TB in immigrants to Canada and validated with national immigration and TB case data. RESULTS : Model simulations suggested that it would be optimal to screen and treat LTBI in new immigrants from countries of birth with an estimated TB incidence rate in excess of 50 per 100 000 person-years. If this strategy had been implemented in 1986, the national TB incidence rate would have fallen by 18.5\%, from 5.4 to 4.4 cases per 100 000 population by 2002. CONCLUSION(S): This study suggests that screening and treating LTBI in foreign-born persons from high TB incidence countries is the most effective strategy in terms of total persons screened and treated and percentage reduction in national incidence. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Union.},

  abstract = {The prevalent paradigm governing bacterial two-component signaling systems (TCSs) is specificity, wherein the histidine kinase (HK) of a TCS exclusively activates its cognate response regulator (RR). Crosstalk, where HKs activate noncognate RRs, is considered evolutionarily disadvantageous because it can compromise adaptive responses by leaking signals. Yet, crosstalk is observed in several bacteria. Here, to resolve this paradox, we propose an alternative paradigm where crosstalk can be advantageous. We envisioned 'programmed' environments, wherein signals appear in predefined sequences. In such environments, crosstalk that primes bacteria to upcoming signals may improve adaptive responses and confer evolutionary benefits. To test this hypothesis, we employed mathematical modeling of TCS signaling networks and stochastic evolutionary dynamics simulations. We considered the comprehensive set of bacterial phenotypes, comprising thousands of distinct crosstalk patterns, competing in varied signaling environments. Our simulations predicted that in programmed environments phenotypes with crosstalk facilitating priming would outcompete phenotypes without crosstalk. In environments where signals appear randomly, bacteria without crosstalk would dominate, explaining the specificity widely seen. Additionally, a testable prediction was that the phenotypes selected in programmed environments would display 'one-way' crosstalk, ensuring priming to 'future' signals. Interestingly, the crosstalk networks we deduced from available data on TCSs of Mycobacterium tuberculosis all displayed one-way crosstalk, offering strong support to our predictions. Our study thus identifies potential evolutionary underpinnings of crosstalk in bacterial TCSs, suggests a reconciliation of specificity and crosstalk, makes testable predictions of the nature of crosstalk patterns selected, and has implications for understanding bacterial adaptation and the response to interventions.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

However, most previous research investigated paratuberculosis control programs in isolation, without modeling the potential association with other dairy diseases. This paper evaluated the benefits of MAP control programs when the herd is also affected by mastitis, a common disease causing the largest losses in dairy production. The effect of typically suggested MAP controls were estimated under the assumption that MAP infection increased the rate of clinical mastitis. We evaluated one hundred twenty three control strategies comprising various combinations of testing, culling, and hygiene, and found that the association of paratuberculosis with mastitis alters the ranking of specific MAP control programs, but only slightly alters the cost-benefit difference of particular MAP control components, as measured by the distribution of net present value of a representative U.S. dairy operation. In particular, although testing and culling for MAP resulted in a reduction in MAP incidence, that control led to lower net present value (NPV) per cow. When testing was used, ELISA was more economically beneficial than alternative testing regimes, especially if mastitis was explicitly modeled as more likely in MAP-infected animals, but ELISA testing was only significantly associated with higher NPV if mastitis was not included in the model at all. Additional hygiene was associated with a lower NPV per cow, although it lowered MAP prevalence. Overall, the addition of an increased risk of mastitis in MAP-infected animals did not change model recommendations as much as failing to consider.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2019 Verteramo Chiu et al.

This is to be distinguished from the clinical efficacy of the same measures. The practical difficulty in assessing the epidemiological effectiveness of control measures expert mentally can be overcome by the construction of simulation models and the use of computers, whereby the problem reduction associated with various control strategies can be estimated numerically. By varying the levels of certain parameters of the model systematically, the sensitivity of the effectiveness of control measures to the epidemiological, operational, clinical and social parameters of a situation can be assessed. A series of articles analyzing this relationship is under preparation. This first article analyzes the sensitivity of the effectiveness of BCG vaccination and of the chemotherapy of tuberculosis to changes in the coverage of the eligible population groups. A previously formulated postulate stating that the marginal effectiveness of these measures decreases as their coverage increases is validated by this first series of simulations. The significance of this finding for planning national tuberculosis control strategies is discussed, as well as possible bias in the method applied.},

  abstract = {Sweden has been considered free from bovine tuberculosis (BTB) since 1958. In 1987 an infected consignment of farmed deer was imported to Sweden and in 1991 the first infected deer was identified. Despite a thorough trace back investigation, all deer originating from the infected consignment could not be traced. Therefore a national control programme for BTB in farmed deer was implemented. At present the control programme is in its final stage and all deer holdings that have not obtained BTB-free status are put under restrictions. This study aimed to determine the probability that the Swedish farmed deer population is free from BTB using methods that allow analysis of non-structured data, i.e. results from meat inspection, necropsies and tuberculin testing. Surveillance data from 1994 to October 2006 from farmed deer affiliated to the voluntary control programme were analysed using the model described in Martin et al. (2007a). The model was adjusted to allow the within-herd design prevalence to be defined as one infected deer per herd and the between-herd design prevalence to be defined as one infected deer herd in the country. Depending on the chosen within-herd design prevalence: 1, 2, 3 or 4 infected deer per herd or 5\% infected deer per herd, the probability of freedom from BTB infection in the Swedish farmed deer population varied between 87\% and 97\%. Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded, with high confidence, that the Swedish farmed deer population is free from M. bovis. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This study proposes a hybrid model combining autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) with a nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) neural network for forecasting the incidence of TB from January 2007 to March 2016. Prediction performance was compared between the hybrid model and the ARIMA model. The best-fit hybrid model was combined with an ARIMA (3,1,0) x (0,1,1)12 and NAR neural network with four delays and 12 neurons in the hidden layer. The ARIMA-NAR hybrid model, which exhibited lower mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error of 0.2209, 0.1373, and 0.0406, respectively, in the modelling performance, could produce more accurate forecasting of TB incidence compared to the ARIMA model. This study shows that developing and applying the ARIMA-NAR hybrid model is an effective method to fit the linear and nonlinear patterns of time-series data, and this model could be helpful in the prevention and control of TB.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2017 Cambridge University Press.},

A decreasing trend (3.17\% per years, P {$<$} 0.01) and seasonal variation of TB notification rate were found from 2005 to 2016 in China, with a predominant peak in spring. A SARIMA model of ARIMA (0,1,1) (0,1,1)12 was identified.

The better performance of the SARIMA-GRNN combination model was further confirmed with the forecasting dataset (2017). TB is a seasonal disease in China, with a predominant peak in spring, and the trend of TB decreased by 3.17\% per year.

  abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the pathogenic bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB), one of the most lethal infectious diseases in the world. The only vaccine against TB is minimally protective, and multi-drug resistant TB necessitates new therapeutics to treat infection. Developing new therapies requires a better understanding of the complex host immune response to infection, including dissecting the processes leading to formation of granulomas, the dense cellular lesions associated with TB. In this work, we pair experimental and computational modeling studies to explore cytokine regulation in the context of TB. We use our next-generation hybrid multi-scale model of granuloma formation (GranSim) to capture molecular, cellular, and tissue scale dynamics of granuloma formation. We identify TGF-beta1 as a major inhibitor of cytotoxic T-cell effector function in granulomas. Deletion of TGF-beta1 from the system results in improved bacterial clearance and lesion sterilization. We also identify a novel dichotomous regulation of cytotoxic T cells and macrophages by TGF-beta1 and IL-10, respectively. These findings suggest that increasing cytotoxic T-cell effector functions may increase bacterial clearance in granulomas and highlight potential new therapeutic targets for treating TB.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2017 Warsinske, Pienaar, Linderman, Mattila and Kirschner.},

Such information has not been widely reported from Pacific islands, nor strongly multi-ethnic settings, and few attempts have been made to quantify contact patterns relevant for the spread of gastrointestinal infections. As part of enteric fever investigations, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of the general public in Fiji, finding that within the 9,650 mealtime contacts reported by 1,814 participants, there was strong like-with-like mixing by age and ethnicity, with higher contact rates amongst iTaukei than non-iTaukei Fijians. Extra-domiciliary lunchtime contacts follow these mixing patterns, indicating the overall data do not simply reflect household structures. Inter-ethnic mixing was most common amongst school-age children. Serological responses indicative of recent Salmonella Typhi infection were found to be associated, after adjusting for age, with increased contact rates between meal-sharing iTaukei, with no association observed for other contact groups. Animal ownership and travel within the geographical division were common. These are novel data that identify ethnicity as an important social mixing variable, and use retrospective mealtime contacts as a socially acceptable metric of relevance to enteric, contact and respiratory diseases that can be collected in a single visit to participants. Application of these data to other island settings will enable communicable disease models to incorporate locally relevant mixing patterns in parameterisation.},

Thus, a high-precision forecasting model can be used for the prevention and control of tuberculosis. In this study, four models including a basic auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, a traditional ARIMA-generalized regression neural network (GRNN) model, a basic GRNN model, and a new ARIMA-GRNN hybrid model were used to fit and predict the incidence of tuberculosis. Parameters including mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean square error (MSE) were used to evaluate and compare the performance of these models for fitting historical and prospective data. The new ARIMA-GRNN model had superior fit relative to both the traditional ARIMA-GRNN model and basic ARIMA model when applied to historical data and when used as a predictive model for forecasting incidence during the subsequent 6 months. Our results suggest that the new ARIMA-GRNN model may bemore suitable for forecasting the tuberculosis incidence in Heng County than traditional models.\textcopyright{} Copyright 2017 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.},

This study was carried out to evaluate the components of the current bTB surveillance program in Belgium and to determine the sensitivity of this program. Secondly, alternatives to optimize the bTB surveillance in accordance with European legislation (. Council Directive 64/432/EEC) were evaluated.Separate scenario trees were designed for each active surveillance component of the bTB surveillance program. Data from 2005 to 2009 regarding cattle population, movement and surveillance were collected to feed the stochastic scenario tree simulation model. A total of 7,403,826 cattle movement history records were obtained for the 2,678,020 cattle from 36,059 cattle herds still active in 2009. The current surveillance program sensitivity as well as the impact of alternative surveillance protocols was simulated in a stochastic model using 10,000 iterations per simulation.The median (50\% percentile) of the component sensitivities across 10,000 iterations was 0.83, 0.85, 0.99, 0.99, respectively, for (i) testing the cattle only during the winter screening, (ii) testing only imported cattle, (iii) testing only purchased cattle and (iv) testing only all slaughtered cattle. The sensitivity analysis showed that the most influential input parameter explaining the variability around the output came from the uncertainty distribution around the sensitivity of the diagnostic tests used within the bTB surveillance. Providing all animals are inspected and post mortem inspection is highly sensitive, slaughterhouse surveillance was the most effective surveillance component. If these conditions were not met, the uncertainty around the mean sensitivity of this component was important. Using an antibody ELISA at purchase and an interferon gamma test during winter screening and at import would increase greatly the sensitivity and the confidence level of Belgium's freedom from bTB infection status. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Individual differences in contact rate can arise from host, group and landscape heterogeneity and can result in different patterns of spatial spread for diseases in wildlife populations with concomitant implications for disease control in wildlife of conservation concern, livestock and humans. While dynamic disease models can provide a better understanding of the drivers of spatial spread, the effects of landscape heterogeneity have only been modelled in a few well-studied wildlife systems such as rabies and bovine tuberculosis. Such spatial models tend to be either purely theoretical with intrinsic limiting assumptions or individual-based models that are often highly species- and system-specific, limiting the breadth of their utility. Our goal was to review studies that have utilized dynamic, spatial models to answer questions about pathogen transmission in wildlife and identify key gaps in the literature. We begin by providing an overview of the main types of dynamic, spatial models (e.g., metapopulation, network, lattice, cellular automata, individual-based and continuous-space) and their relation to each other. We investigate different types of ecological questions that these models have been used to explore: pathogen invasion dynamics and range expansion, spatial heterogeneity and pathogen persistence, the implications of management and intervention strategies and the role of evolution in host-pathogen dynamics. We reviewed 168 studies that consider pathogen transmission in free-ranging wildlife and classify them by the model type employed, the focal host-pathogen system, and their overall research themes and motivation. We observed a significant focus on mammalian hosts, a few well-studied or purely theoretical pathogen systems, and a lack of studies occurring at the wildlife-public health or wildlife-livestock interfaces. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions in the context of unprecedented human-mediated environmental change. Spatial models may provide new insights into understanding, for example, how global warming and habitat disturbance contribute to disease maintenance and emergence. Moving forward, better integration of dynamic, spatial disease models with approaches from movement ecology, landscape genetics/genomics and ecoimmunology may provide new avenues for investigation and aid in the control of zoonotic and emerging infectious diseases.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2017 The Authors.

  abstract = {A spatial stochastic simulation model was used to assess the potential of fertility control, based on a yet-to-be-developed oral bait-delivered contraceptive directed at females, for the control of bovine tuberculosis in badger populations in south-west England. The contraceptive had a lifelong effect so that females rendered sterile in any particular year remained so for the rest of their lives. The efficacy of fertility control alone repeated annually for varying periods of time was compared with a single culling operation and integrated control involving an initial single cull followed by annually repeated fertility control. With fertility control alone, in no instance was the disease eradicated completely while a viable badger population (mean group size of at least one individual) was still maintained. Near eradication of the disease (less than 1\% prevalence) combined with the survival of a minimum viable badger population was only achieved under a very limited set of conditions, either with high efficiency of control (95\%) over a short time period (1-3 years) or a low efficiency of control (20\%) over an intermediate time period (10-20 years). Under these conditions, it took more than 20 years for the disease to decline to such low levels. A single cull of 80\% efficiency succeeded in near eradication of the disease (below 1\% prevalence) after a period of 6-8 years, while still maintaining a viable badger population. Integrated strategies reduced disease prevalence more rapidly and to lower levels than culling alone, although the mean badger group size following the onset of control was smaller. Under certain integrated strategies, principally where a high initial cull (80\%) was followed by fertility control over a short (1-3 year) time period, the disease could be completely eradicated while a viable badger population was maintained. However even under the most favourable conditions of integrated control, it took on average more than 12 years following the onset of control for the disease to disappear completely from the badger population. These results show that whilst fertility control would not be a successful strategy for the control of bovine tuberculosis in badgers if used alone, it could be effective if used with culling as part of an integrated strategy. This type of integrated strategy is likely to be more effective in terms of disease eradication than a strategy employing culling alone. However, the high cost of developing a suitable fertility control a combined with the welfare and conservation implications, are significant factors which should be taken into account when considering its possible use as a means of controlling bovine tuberculosis in badger populations in the UK.},

  abstract = {Background Individual-based models (IBMs) are useful to simulate events subject to stochasticity and/or heterogeneity, and have become well established to model the potential (re)emergence of pathogens (e.g., pandemic influenza, bioterrorism). Individual heterogeneity at the host and pathogen level is increasingly documented to influence transmission of endemic diseases and it is well understood that the final stages of elimination strategies for vaccine-preventable childhood diseases (e.g., polio, measles) are subject to stochasticity. Even so it appears IBMs for both these phenomena are not well established. We review a decade of IBM publications aiming to obtain insights in their advantages, pitfalls and rationale for use and to make recommendations facilitating knowledge transfer within and across disciplines. Methods We systematically identified publications in Web of Science and PubMed from 2006-2015 based on title/abstract/keywords screening (and full-text if necessary) to retrieve topics, modeling purposes and general specifications. We extracted detailed modeling features from papers on established vaccine-preventable childhood diseases based on full-text screening. Results We identified 698 papers, which applied an IBM for infectious disease transmission, and listed these in a reference database, describing their general characteristics. The diversity of disease-topics and overall publication frequency have increased over time (38 to 115 annual publications from 2006 to 2015). The inclusion of intervention strategies (8 to 52) and economic consequences (1 to 20) are increasing, to the detriment of purely theoretical explorations. Unfortunately, terminology used to describe IBMs is inconsistent and ambiguous. We retrieved 24 studies on a vaccine-preventable childhood disease (covering 7 different diseases), with publication frequency increasing from the first such study published in 2008. IBMs have been useful to explore heterogeneous between- and within-host interactions, but combined applications are still sparse. The amount of missing information on model characteristics and study design is remarkable. Conclusions IBMs are suited to combine heterogeneous within- and between-host interactions, which offers many opportunities, especially to analyze targeted interventions for endemic infections. We advocate the exchange of (open-source) platforms and stress the need for consistent ``branding''. Using (existing) conventions and reporting protocols would stimulate cross-fertilization between research groups and fields, and ultimately policy making in decades to come.

  abstract = {Epidemics of HIV/AIDS have increased the tuberculosis (TB) case-load by five or more times in East Africa and southern Africa. As HIV continues to spread, warnings have been issued of disastrous AIDS and TB epidemics in "new-wave" countries, including India, which accounts for 20\% of all new TB cases arising in the world each year. Here we investigate whether, in the face of the HIV epidemic. India's Revised National TB Control Program (RNTCP) could halve TB prevalence and death rates in the period 1990-2015, as specified by the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Using a mathematical model to capture the spatial and temporal variation in TB and HIV in India, we predict that, without the RNTCP, HIV would increase TB prevalence (by 1\%), incidence (by 12\%), and mortality rates (by 33\%) between 1990 and 2015. With the RNTCP, however, we expect substantial reductions in prevalence (by 68\%), incidence (by 41\%), and mortality (by 39\%) between 1990 and 2015. In India, 29\% of adults but 72\% of HIV-positive adults live in four large states in the south where, even with the RNTCP, mortality is expected to fall by only 15\% between 1990 and 2015. Nationally, the RNTCP should be able to reverse the increases in TB burden due to HIV but, to ensure that TB mortality is reduced by 50\% or more by 2015, HIV-infected TB patients should be provided with antiretroviral therapy in addition to the recommended treatment for TB. \textcopyright{} 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

  abstract = {Background: To determine the consequences of severe undernutrition and refeeding on whole-body metabolism and protein synthesis. Method(s): Respiratory quotient (RQ), resting energy expenditure (REE), and whole-body protein synthesis (WBPS) were assessed in undernourished patients, with anorexia nervosa (n = 8) or with coexistent disease (n = 17). Results were compared with 17 healthy controls. Six anorexic patients and 13 disease patients consented to study after nutrition support. Result(s): Mean body mass index was 12.46 +/- 0.53 kg/m2 in the anorexia patients and 13.81 +/- 0.40 kg/m 2 in the disease patients (controls 23.71 +/- 0.72 kg/m 2; p {$<$} .001). Compared with controls, RQ was similar in anorexia patients (0.85 +/- 0.05 vs 0.90 +/- 0.05) but lower in the disease patients (0.76 +/- 0.03 vs 0.90 +/- 0.05; p = .02). REE was lower in the patients (anorexia 1058 +/- 134.0 kcal/d, disease 1189 +/- 101.4 kcal/d vs 1828 +/- 89.76 kcal/d; p {$<$} .001); however, expressed as kcal/kg/d, it was higher (anorexia 32.17 +/- 4.25, disease 31.30 +/- 2.14 vs 25.07 +/- 1.00; p {$<$} .05). WBPS was lower in the patients (anorexia 140.9 +/- 10.54 g/d, disease 119.8 +/- 8.57 g/d vs 305.0 +/- 21.64 g/d; p {$<$} .001); however, when expressed as g/kg/d, the anorexia patients were similar to controls, whereas the disease patients were lower (3.11 +/- 0.24 vs 4.27 +/- 0.32; p {$<$} .05). Refeeding increased RQ in the disease patients (0.84 +/- 0.03 vs 0.76 +/- 0.03; p {$<$} .05), and normalized REE (anorexia 27.65 +/- 3.05 kcal/kg/d, disease 28.90 +/- 1.85 kcal/kg/d). WBPS increased in the disease patients (173.6 +/- 16.38 g/d vs 116.5 +/- 10.15 g/d; p {$<$} .01). Conclusion(s): Undernutrition is associated with increased REE (kcal/kg/d). Reduction in RQ and protein synthesis (g/kg/d) was evident in those patients with coexistent disease. Refeeding resulted in normalization of RQ, REE (kcal/kg/d), and protein synthesis (g/kg/d).

  abstract = {The hallmarks of pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection are lung granulomas. These organized structures are composed of host immune cells whose purpose is to contain or clear infection, creating a complex hub of immune and bacterial cell activity, as well as limiting pathology in the lungs. Yet, given cellular activity and the potential for frequent interactions between host immune cells and M. tuberculosis-infected cells, we observed a surprisingly low quantity of cytokine-producing T cells ( {$<$} 10\% of granuloma T cells) in our recent study of M. tuberculosis infection within nonhuman primate (NHP) granulomas. Various mechanisms could limit T cell function, and one hypothesis is T cell exhaustion. T cell exhaustion is proposed to result from continual antigen stimulation, inducing them to enter a state characterized by low cytokine production, low proliferation, and expression of a series of inhibitory receptors, the most common being PD-1, LAG-3, and CTLA-4. In this work, we characterized the expression of inhibitory receptors on T cells and the functionality of these cells in tuberculosis (TB) lung granulomas. We then used these experimental data to calibrate and inform an agent-based computational model that captures environmental, cellular, and bacterial dynamics within granulomas in lungs during M. tuberculosis infection. Together, the results of the modeling and the experimental work suggest that T cell exhaustion alone is not responsible for the low quantity of M. tuberculosis-responsive T cells observed within TB granulomas and that the lack of exhaustion is likely an intrinsic property of granuloma structure.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2018 American Society for Microbiology.},

In particular, such processes can model evolutionary dynamics of transposable elements-important genetic markers in molecular epidemiology. Estimation of the effects of individual covariates on the birth, death, and shift rates of the process can be accomplished by analyzing patient data, but inferring these rates in a discretely and unevenly observed setting presents computational challenges. We propose a multi-type branching process approximation to BDS processes and develop a corresponding expectation maximization algorithm, where we use spectral techniques to reduce calculation of expected sufficient statistics to low-dimensional integration. These techniques yield an efficient and robust optimization routine for inferring the rates of the BDS process, and apply broadly to multi-type branching processes whose rates can depend on many covariates. After rigorously testing our methodology in simulation studies, we apply our method to study intrapatient time evolution of IS6110 transposable element, a genetic marker frequently used during estimation of epidemiological clusters of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections.

Design(s): We used a clinical database of HIV-infected patients to calculate the resource use and cost of care for different stages of HIV infection. Costs were incorporated into a computer-based, probabilistic simulation model of the natural history and treatment of HIV infection to estimate the lifetime cost of treating patients with HIV disease. Setting(s): A northern France HIV clinical cohort. Participant(s): 1232 HIV-infected patients followed from January 1994 through July 1998. Result(s): In the absence of an AIDS-defining event, the average total cost of care ranged from 670 euros (1 euro=US \$1.19) per person-month in the highest CD4 stratum ({$>$}500/mul) to 1060 euros per person-month in the lowest CD4 stratum ({$<$}=550/mul). The mean cost of care was estimated at 3370 euros per person-month during the initial months around the occurrence of an AIDS-defining event; at 1750 euros per person-month during the period spanning from 2 months after the diagnosis of specific AIDS-defining event to 1 month prior to death; and at 13 010 euros per person-month in the final month prior to death. If clinical management of HIV infection began at a CD4 cell count of 378/mul, as in this cohort, the discounted lifetime cost of treating an HIV-infected French patient was estimated at 214000 euros. The undiscounted costs were 309 000 euros over a projected life expectancy of 16.4 years. Conclusion(s): The cost of HIV disease varies widely depending upon the stage of illness. These estimates of stage-specific and lifetime costs of HIV care will assist health policy planners in assessing the burden of disease in the era of HAART and projecting future resource requirements.},

  abstract = {DevS is a heme-based sensor kinase required for sensing environmental conditions leading to nonreplicating persistence in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Kinase activity is observed when the heme is a ferrous five-coordinate high-spin or six-coordinate low-spin CO or NO complex but is strongly inhibited in the oxy complex. Discrimination between these exogenous ligands has been proposed to depend on a specific hydrogen bond network with bound oxygen. Here we report resonance Raman data and autophosphorylation assays of wild-type and Y171F DevS in various heme complexes. The Y171F mutation eliminates ligand discrimination for CO, NO, and O2, resulting in equally inactive complexes. In contrast, the ferrous-deoxy Y171F variant exhibits autokinase activity equivalent to that of the wild type. Raman spectra of the oxy complex of Y171F indicate that the environment of the oxy group is significantly altered from that in the wild type. They also suggest that a solvent molecule in the distal pocket substitutes for the Tyr hydroxyl group to act as a poorer hydrogen bond donor to the oxy group. The wild-type CO and NO complexes exist as a major population in which the CO or NO groups are free of hydrogen bonds, while the Y171F mutation results in a mild increase in the distal pocket polarity. The Y171F mutation has no impact on the proximal environment of the heme, and the activity observed with the five-coordinate ferrous-deoxy wild type is conserved in the Y171F variant. Thus, while the absence of an exogenous ligand in the ferrous-deoxy proteins leads to a moderate kinase activity, interactions between Tyr171 and distal diatomic ligands turn the kinase activity on and off. The Y17IF mutation disrupts the on-off switch and renders all states with a distal ligand inactive. This mechanistic model is consistent with Tyr171 being required for distal ligand discrimination, but nonessential for autophosphorylation activity. \textcopyright{} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

Given Q(in) = 15 and 30 L/min and a realistic inlet velocity profile, the experimentally validated computer simulation model provided some interesting 3-D airflow patterns, i.e., for each TB-unit they depend on the upstream condition, local geometry and local Reynolds number. Directly coupled to the local airflow fields are the convective-diffusive transport and deposition of nanoparticles, i.e., 1 nm {$<$} or = d(p) 10 nm, the geometric effects, including daughter-branch rotation, are minor. Furthermore, the deposition efficiencies at each individual bifurcation in the TB region can be well correlated as a function of an effective diffusion parameter.},

The adaptive immune effect was best described by a sigmoidal function on both bacterial load and incubation time. Applications to demonstrate the utility of this baseline model showed (i) the important influence of the adaptive immune response on pyrazinamide (PZA) drug efficacy, (ii) a persistent adaptive immune effect in mice relapsing after chemotherapy cessation, and (iii) the protective effect of vaccines after M. tuberculosis challenge.

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease with a peculiar feature: Upon infection with the causative agent, Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB), most hosts enter a latent state during which no transmission of MTB to new hosts occurs. Only a fraction of latently infected hosts develop TB disease and can potentially infect new hosts. At first glance, this seems like a waste of transmission potential and therefore an evolutionary suboptimal strategy for MTB. It might be that the human immune response keeps MTB in check in most hosts, thereby preventing it from achieving its evolutionary optimum. Another possible explanation is that long latency and progression to disease in only a fraction of hosts are evolutionary beneficial to MTB by allowing it to persist better in small host populations. Given that MTB has co-evolved with human hosts for millenia or longer, it likely encountered small host populations for a large share of its evolutionary history and had to evolve strategies of persistence. Here, we use a mathematical model to show that indeed, MTB persistence is optimal for an intermediate duration of latency and level of activation. The predicted optimal level of activation is above the observed value, suggesting that human co-evolution has lead to host immunity, which keeps MTB below its evolutionary optimum. \textcopyright{} 2014 Zheng et al.},

  abstract = {Objectives: We hypothesize that multiple re-exposures to tuberculosis (TB) within a short period after initial infection confers greater likelihood of developing active infection within one year of initial infection, a phenomenon we refer to as complex contagion. The purpose of this research is to study the effect of treatment targeted to highly re-exposed infected individuals in a TB outbreak with complex contagion. Method(s): We built and validated an agent-based simulation model (ABM) of a TB epidemic, parameterized with epidemiological data from a series of TB outbreaks in the 20th century in western Canada. We developed a novel calibration procedure to fit two versions of the model: one without complex contagion (base model) and one with complex contagion, where the risk of developing active TB follows a sigmoidal function with a small number of re-exposures conferring low risk of activation and a high number of re-exposures conferring high risk of activation. We tested two treatment strategies: mass treatment for actively infected agents (untargeted strategy) and prophylactic treatment for highly re-exposed infected agents in addition to mass treatment for active agents (untargeted strategy). Result(s): We find that given the same treatment regimen, the incidence rate under the targeted strategy is 6\% lower than that under the untargeted strategy in the year following treatment introduction. TB-specific mortality under the targeted strategy is 5\% lower than under the untargeted strategy. Under the targeted strategy, 5\% fewer active infections need to be treated to achieve the same incidence and mortality rate as the untargeted strategy. Including prophylactic treatment for highly re-exposed agents, 2\% fewer agents are treated overall in the targeted compared to the untargeted strategy. Conclusion(s): Targeted treatment resulted in greater decreases in incidence and mortality, with fewer agents receiving treatment, compared to the untargeted strategy. Our findings suggest that targeting highly re-exposed individuals may decrease treatment costs.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020},
