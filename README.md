# TBDynamics: A Compartmental Model for TB Dynamics in Vietnam
## Overview:
TBDynamics is a Python-based modeling tool developed to understand and analyze the dynamics of tuberculosis (TB) in Vietnam. Leveraging the power of the summerepi2 package, TBDynamics offers a comprehensive compartmental model that simulates TB transmission, progression, and control strategies.
## Features:
- **Compartmental Modeling**: Implements a sophisticated model capturing various stages of TB infection and treatment.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows users to tailor model parameters to reflect local demographics, infection rates, and healthcare practices in Vietnam.
- **Data Integration**: Capable of incorporating real-world data for more accurate modeling.
- **Simulation and Analysis**: Offers tools for running simulations over specified time periods and analyzing the outcomes.
