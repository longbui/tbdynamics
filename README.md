# TBDynamics: A Compartmental Model for simulating Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission dynamics in Vietnam
## Overview:
TBDynamics is a Python-based modeling tool developed to simulating Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) transmission in Vietnam . Leveraging the power of the [summer](https://summer2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) a Python-based framework for the creation and execution of compartmental models (or “state-based”) epidemiological models of infectious disease transmission, TBDynamics offers a comprehensive compartmental model that simulates TB transmission, progression, and control strategies.
## Features:
- **Compartmental Modeling**: Implements a sophisticated model capturing various stages of M.tb infection and TB diseases.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows users to tailor model parameters.
- **Data Integration**: Capable of incorporating real-world data for more accurate modelling.
- **Simulation and Analysis**: Offers tools for running simulations over specified time periods and analyzing the outcomes.
